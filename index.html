“Leave the broken, irreversible past behind, and step out into the invincible future.”
- Oswald Chambers

One day it will all make sense, this dying business. I’ll wake up and know why he’s gone, why I’m here, why cancer, why now. I’ll know the answers to the big questions that hang ‘round my shoulders like an itchy sweater. I’ll have clarity. Oh, to have clarity again! Answers and clarity and a big giant old hug from my dad.
Down he went, faster and faster, at the end. And there I was clutching glimpses and shadows and memories, frantically catching life as it fell and putting it back on the shelf. His condition worsened and my control withered.

I couldn’t do anything to stop it. One moment, my dad is taking us all out to dinner, passing advice and menus around the table, recounting every detail of his football adventures or his plumbing exploits or his passionate care for his favorite people. The next moment he’s in a hospital bed, speaking oddly and urgently. Then surgery. Then home. Then chemo and radiation. Recovery! Relapse. Then the long wind, down, down, down to the end.

His is a story not of losing but of living. The living got a lot harder to do as cancer kept a-coming, but in retrospect, his final days with us are not the ones I will remember most vividly. I neither want nor intend for his story to be defined by brain cancer.

That being said, brain cancer certainly joined the cast there at the end.

It came on like a hyperlapse shadow, enveloping us as it entered our lives. Without warning, the towers of my childhood fell like dominoes---a phone call, an urgent voice, a mad dash to the car and down the highway and into the abyss.

I met him in his hospital bed, still my dad yet also not. He was speaking deeply, madly about his love for me, saying the sweetest things with the littlest of filter. “You know you are my favorite.” What? You can’t say that, Dad. His frantic nature, his free-flowing jams, were the cancer already at work.

We hoped it wasn’t cancer, of course, like the dog hopes it’s not the vet. The MRI came. We sank. Then surgery, then diagnosis, then the crater up and swallowed us whole. Not only did my dad have brain cancer, he had it as bad as anyone can have it---stage four out of four, glioblastoma, the incurable, ineffable version of the meanest cancer around. A person lives 24 months if they’re charmed, typically much less.

Good months would follow --- good enough that I found myself falling into the eerie comfort of existing side-by-side with dormant cancer. We went on a family vacation to Tahoe and laughed the hugest laughs when we ate all the ice cream bars in the freezer just before the condo cleaners came back to claim them. We held birthday parties on the back deck, and I broke out the old-fashioned ice cream churn to grind out some good eats. We did things that didn’t involve ice cream also, I’m almost sure.

My dad went back to work. He drove again. He played golf. He did all the dad things he so loved doing, cramming as much life as possible in before the clouds came. And when they came, they came swift and hard, starting with teasing imperfections---a forgotten name here, a stumble there---and moving into deeper, darker, debilitating territory with my dad’s words, his mobility, his clarity and his mind.

I never got the chance to ask him what he thought of death. Death was too busy digging ditches in his brain. I never got the chance to stop cancer dead in its tracks, to take that overnight certification in brain surgery and cancer-bustin’ and cure this irrational evil before it had the chance to afflict any other innocent dads.

I tried like mad to stop it. I tried to wrap a tourniquet around my life, to bring things to a grinding halt so that nothing worse could happen than already did. Each day and each moment felt like the most we could take. If I could stop things here, we’d be fine. If I could slow down the mudslide, we’d all survive. I was a desperate boy clinging onto the leg of an ambivalent monster as it walked into the room and I begged it to not, with my arms wrapped tight around its ankle, just along for the ride as completely helpless as I wanted to be completely helpful.

Along the way there were Mayo clinics and calls to Duke and a bunch of Google searches. We gave it our best shot, and then one incredibly bright and depressingly dark day, the first of June, we hit the end of the line. No more treatment. No more chemo or radiation. No more options of any kind.

So many amazing things had happened in life over the previous year. My dad became a grandfather, and I became a dad. We were days away from my brother’s wedding. Plumbing business had picked up, and there was hope and joy and possibility abounding.

Now, we hung on.

Henry James described sorrow as a “great wave that rolls over us.” He says, “though it may almost smother us it leaves us on the spot and we know that if it is strong we are stronger, inasmuch as it passes and we remain. It wears us, uses us, but we wear it and use it in return; and it is blind, whereas we after a manner see.” Beautiful and accurate. We were soaked -- still are -- by the spray of the wave, dropped repeatedly by waves that refused to abate, waves that just kept coming one after the other while our balance and swimming suits failed to hold. It smothered us then. We will be stronger now.

I helped choose a hospice agency for my father, before I turned 30 and he turned 60. I helped him eat. I helped him sit. I helped him walk. I did my best to help him communicate the names and objects and perhaps even the emotions running through his head, so clear to him and so cloudy to us. I answered my phone in the dead of night to come to the house and help my dad up from a fall.

These were the dark times, the times you tell yourself you won’t remember though you can hardly trust the lie. How can you not remember? The detail was so great and so out-of-this-world. Every moment so emotional and draining. I went into the summer a 29-year-old boy and left a different man.

During my dad’s final days, we sat idly by as the moving walkway pulled us toward the end. We spent as much time at my parents’ house as we could. We sat together. Talked together. Stole away moments when we could - resting together on the couch, me and my dad; chatting in the hallway about The End, me and my mom.

And then The End came. I was the one sitting by his side when he breathed his last. A rattle, a pause, and silence. Peace.

It’s what I experienced in those two years and what I’ve discovered since that has resonated so deeply with me. I endured those things we’ll all endure - cancer, losing a parent, death and destruction - and I endured these things, hoping and praying no one would ever have to go endure alone.

You are not alone. I’ve been there. Others have, too. We are a brigade of bravery, wandering toward the light, figuring things out by our hearts and whims. We are one, together, even when we can’t be whole on our own.

Here’s my story.

--

2. 

I want very badly to remember my dad the way I knew him and loved him before cancer. I want to remember him with the same reflex that I can recall my childhood phone number. I want those memories to come easy for me, to shove aside any of the new memories that were made during the trying times, for the good ol' memories to elbow the bad ones outta the way.

I can picture us now, my dad driving and my mom in the passenger seat, my younger brother behind him and me behind her. I'm 10 years old, wide-eyed with vacation frenzy. We're driving to a theme park, but we could be driving anywhere. I'd go happily to the edge of the earth with these people, radio tuned to Santana, Gameboy in hand, not a worry to be seen.

My dad has found his groove, figuratively and literally---he's away from work with the people he loves, and there's a pretty rad song on the radio. Thus, the air piano.

The air piano is a difficult instrument to master. It takes elegance, innovation, imagination, and uninhibited  joy. You can really hammer away on an air piano, tickling the imaginary ivories with immeasurable, overflowing joy. And you have to really sell it. The experts, like my dad, recognize the perfect opportunity and know the ideal hand placement. You go up and down the scales, as if every note were a four-octave slide. You jam your fingers up and down as you play, emphasizing notes that may or may not be in the song, keeping in time to the rhythm if it’s convenient for your act. You toss your hair back and laugh. You really let it loose, like your laugh is taking the weight of the world off your shoulders, like your impromptu piano recital is the greatest show on earth.

From the backseat, it’s a pretty good show. I’ve got the perfect view of my dad, the maestro, driving with his knees, at 80 miles per hour down the interstate while he bangs out a Top 40 tune on the dashboard. His fingers strike the dash with gusto, and I think it’s the greatest thing I’ve ever seen. People should pay money to see this man go Ray Charles in our Suburban. For most kids my age, my mind would be overwhelmed with the thought of our destination. We’re driving to an amusement park on a family vacation, and the amusement park has water slides. Water slides! I’m surprised my body didn’t shut down to conserve energy for the Tasmanian Devil of a time I’m going to have at the amusement park.

Amusement parks can wait. I am at the most incredible concert. I am in the midst of air piano greatness. My dad is transformed in the driver’s seat---no longer in work mode, he’s kicked off his boots, hung his hat on the rack, and put on his Superman clothes. The song lasts for maybe two minutes, maybe it’s just the bridge and it lasts for one, but the piano playing has stuck. I’ve experienced my dad at his happiest, and I’ll never forget. At the time, I’m just loving this piano show. Maybe some day I’ll be as good as he is, I think to myself. I laugh and laugh and can’t take my eyes off it. Twenty years later, the memory is still fresh.

My dad in the driver’s seat. Both hands clapping on the dashboard. A Utah freeway whizzing past, billboards for restaurants and stores I’ve never heard of. He is at perfect peace, and so happy. We are all so happy. And we'll forever be happy, together, so long as I can hold the memory in.

***

Again, I can see him so clearly: jogging with teenagers, back and forth on a football field. In a matter of minutes, he’ll be yelling at them, coaching them, encouraging them, and inspiring them. I’m a little biased on that last one. He is simply the best at coaching junior high football. Again, slightly very biased.

He’ll tell you, if you ask and sometimes if you didn’t, that he coached in 100 games and won 80. He was a four-time junior high Class 3A football champion, according to his figuring since no one officially hands out junior high championships. Technically he's right. His teams won more games than anyone in each of those four years. We went ahead and hung the make-believe championship banners.

He jogs with the kids every day. Flagpole and back. He is 55 years old, and he’s as healthy as can be.

I am partly responsible for the coaching. Somewhere along the way, I developed a love for football, and my dad came along for the ride. I recited football scoreboard story problems as a child---a strange, odd little child with a knack for totaling touchdowns, PATs, safeties, and field goals into any number you could conjure. Forty-seven? Five touchdowns with extra points and four field goals. One-hundred-seventy-four? 17 touchdowns with extra points, 17 field goals, and two safeties.

I kept loving football from age three until now. My dad was right there with me. To explain just how unique it was that a man whose high school background and childhood was nowhere near the path of sports fan is still baffling to me. He rode bulls and hung out with the anti-jocks in high school. Football was off his radar and on an entirely different plane. How’d he come to love it so much? Why’d he come to love it? Well, I imagine the why was because of us kids. He loved us with every fiber of his being, even the fibers that took away from fishing and golf and rodeo and replaced them with the Kansas City Chiefs and third-and-eight.

Did I mention he owned coaching videos?

I wish I could say they were DVDs, but no, they were VHS in those big puffy cases that snap open and closed and feel as if they will endure long after the world is incinerated in fire. There they’ll be, floating off into space, with a coach in shorts and a three-point stance blowing a whistle on the cover for eternity.

The tapes were just the beginning for my dad.

He had a binder full of plays.

He had books and reams of paper.

He had wristbands, painstakingly created by a dogged worker, me.

Our wristband sessions were epic. I would sit at the family desktop computer, which I can literally count on my hands the times that my dad used: He looked at a plumbing bid once, he sat and scrolled through Kelley Blue Book listings for trucks, after I explained to him the proper direction to scroll (you scroll down and the page moves up, and now come to think of it that makes no sense at all how do any of us know how to scroll). Wristbands were entirely beyond him, so he hired me.

I created a column layout in Microsoft Word and began typing up the names of various junior high school football plays. My dad cared deeply about these wristbands. Things must be capitalized correctly and spaced legibly. He knew not to leave any gray areas for 12-year-olds to misinterpret, calling Z Slant Right 242 Dog when they should be calling Z Slant Right 424 Daryl. No, these wristbands needed to be perfect, if it took us an hour to complete. It would often take us two or three.

Now here is my dad at practice, calling plays off the wristband like Napoleon organizing his troops.  My dad’s army comes to the line of scrimmage gangly and haphazardly, half of them forget the snap count, one of them forgets the play, everything moves in molasses, and the team gains two yards. They are scrimmaging against air.

“Doggone it!”

My dad slams his hand against his clipboard. He pirouettes in an anger swirl, rolling his eyes and clenching his jaw. He storms toward his army of goofs. This is my dad at his maddest. It isn’t all that mad.

“What was the play, Dylan?” my dad asks the quarterback.

Dylan cannot precisely say.

“You fake the handoff here, turn and pitch.”

My dad takes the ball from the center and proceeds with an exhibition. He squats, holding the ball in front of him with both hands as if he had just received the snap. He mimes the entire sequence---all of Dylan’s movements from fake handoff, 180-degree turn, pitch, and playfake---and he does so with energy. He moves at a smooth full speed with no wasted effort, like he’s been playing quarterback and running this play his whole life. You get the sense that he is kind of glad that Dylan did it wrong because it gave my dad the chance to do it right. Was this his plan all along? Was Dylan set up for failure? Good conspiracy theory, but no. My dad loves Dylan, and as he will tell us all later that night during dinner and after dinner and, I’m only guessing here, as he and my mom fall asleep together in bed, Dylan has to get this right by the game on Tuesday. The game is against Melba. My dad cannot lose to Melba.

Birthdays are unfathomably important to me, for reasons I cannot immediately pin down---probably some Adlerian psychology explanation having to do with my overabundance of attention and feeling a need to justify being selfish. Your birthday is the one day of the year devoted solely to you. It is yours and no one else’s. The other 364 days are ordinary, normal, excuse-free, but your birthday? Man, that’s the golden ticket. You can do whatever you want, however you want, whenever you want. You are worth celebrating, so you’d better make the most of it in the 24 hours you’ve got. It’s someone else’s turn tomorrow. You get the parade today.

I impel my friends to celebrate birthdays the way I do. I converted Lindsay into a birthday believer. Her July 30ths are now her domain, and she rules as queen over every detail of the day. She loves it, or if she doesn’t, she keeps her displeasure from me so as not to crush me. My other friends and family play along with my delusions, too. I make a big deal out of everybody’s birthday because I feel birthdays deserve to be a big deal, and people have learned to just deal with it. I am 30 years old and still make a birthday wish list. You should, too. I’d love to buy you a little something.

Don’t get me wrong. My birthdays don’t look like a music video, cash raining from the skies, bling everywhere, big cars with unreasonably large amounts of chrome rims. No, I prefer on my birthday to release myself from all obligation and duty to others, let myself take the day off of people pleasing, literally take the day off work, and do all the boring, small, insignificant things that I find totally significant. I play video games. I eat at my favorite restaurants. I read magazines in a Barnes & Noble. I am not high maintenance in the least, even though I am king. It’s good to be king.

For my 28th birthday, I did the typical slow play. Video games in the morning, pizza for lunch, presents whenever I said so. Dinner was to be my choice---as it should---and I had a few places in mind, burgers mainly. Then the planning party hit. My dad needed to be at football practice, or was it work, or was it both. He needed to be somewhere else at a certain time, and that meant our dinner plans had to fit with his schedule. I thought nothing of it, other than that all my favorite burger joints were out of the question. We landed at a barbecue place on the drag of a nearby town, had a quick bite, did your typical royal birthday things, and called it. My dad went about his business, and we leftovers---mom, Lindsay, me---kept the party going by, I don’t know, going to Barnes & Noble probably. I read a Wired, two Entertainment Weeklys, and a Spin.

It wasn't until later, when we were wracking our minds for omens of my dad's illness, that we recognized how odd it was that he wasn't involved, that he came and went so quickly from my party. The birthday became my unofficial Patient Zero, the day when life stopped being predictable and cozy and familiar. The day when it all started.

***

Deep conversations in a McDonald’s wrapped in a gas station tend to happen when you don't expect them, nor should you when you're eating fries next to a Slurpee machine. I've been in these weird spots twice. .The first, I was there to kill time while I waited for Lindsay to hang out elsewhere with a friend. My stayover at the McD’s-Chevron included a police investigation into a haggard couple who may or may not have been squatting---i.e., living---in a McDonald’s booth. I steeled myself for a gun fight, not knowing if anyone even had guns, but just to be safe. No shots were fired. Fake IDs were discovered, and that was it. CSI is a lie.

The second time was with my dad.

Me, Lindsay, he, and my mom stopped on the way home from a night out together. My dad’s impromptu food needs were legendary. He would get urges that were either borne of an empty stomach or---and this is most likely the case---a desire to have fun, make memories, and treat those he loved the most. Ice cream was a classic, and he enjoyed a good McDonald’s ice cream cone. He’d ask my mom if she wanted something, which I came to learn meant that really he wanted something.

We went inside the McDonald’s-Chevron, another dad quirk. He and drive-throughs got along sometimes, but rarely when I was in the car with him. We went inside and ate. I got a McFlurry. He and my mom shared a cone. Lindsay got her own.

And we sat there and talked. We were the only people in the place, well after 8:00 p.m., late enough that the chairs were turned onto tables and the floors were being swept. We had the place to ourselves, and we talked.

We went back and forth about topics that you don’t often hear about in a McDonald’s. My dad told us all about his plan for retiring, some day, and how he would transfer his plumbing business to a long-time employee. He went into great detail---more detail than he had ever gone into. Numbers and figures and timetables, and this coming from a man who never told me how much he made and always changed the subject whenever I brought up money. He pulled back the curtain that night and was completely transparent about the whole process. My mom sat quietly beside. Lindsay and I peppered him with questions, me with extra pepper because come on this might be my only chance to ever find this stuff out.

I felt like an equal. I felt like an adult, not a child; a peer, not an outsider. My dad spoke to me as if I had achieved some sort of transcendent stage of maturity. I was being trusted with classified information, and the beans were being spilled completely free of fear or trepidation. My dad respected me enough to tell me everything.

Then things got even deeper. He asked me about my work. He never talked about my work. It was enough for him that I worked in a white collar job that paid enough to support my family. Details were unnecessary.

But tonight? Tonight he wanted to know.

I explained the process of what I do. Distributors for my company need information and materials, so I write the words and send them out. I am a marketer. I market. Emails, magazines, info sheets, print pieces. I do a little bit of everything.

I could tell this was a little too confusing for him to take in, being how he comes from a completely different, blue-collar world. He asked me a question to clarify, though I think it muddled things worse. No matter. He didn’t need to ask the right questions or understand at all what I do. Simply asking had made my day.

We ended the conversation and headed home, as a couple made out at the counter.

***

Near the end of October, we held a party for my great aunt who was turning a multiple of 45. At least, we think she is. Nobody is sure of her age, and she’s not telling, which makes us all wonder if she isn’t all that sure of her age either.

She and her best friend and sister-in-law live at the retirement community together, a few doors down and one floor up from each other, always meeting for dinner and trips to the Macy’s in the mall.

These ladies are my dad’s purview. He cares for them like a Boy Scout cares for a fire, responsibly and without deference to most anything else that is going on. He makes sure they have rides to church, he makes sure they have their money in order, he deals with any and every problem that arrives. He is enormously responsible for them---his aunts, neither of whom ever had any children of their own and whose husbands have long since passed. He is their caretaker and guardian. My mom is their puzzle and chocolates dealer.

These days it’s not entirely clear what they know. They have met Lindsay many, many times, and they still give her a glossy-eyed look each time we are together at a family event. It’s the kind of look that says they have no idea who she is but she sure is standing close to that other person who looks vaguely familiar. That vaguely familiar person is me. I’m not sure they remember me.

Lindsay and I helped my mom set up the cake and snacks and did our requisite meet-n-greeting, before retreating as fast as socially acceptable to stand behind the cake table and melt into the carpet. We didn't recognize anyone, and everyone was old. It was what life must be like for my great aunts except age backward.

My dad was a wonder man, jumping from group to group and conversation to conversation, making sure everyone was comfortable and at ease. He greeted out of town relatives, he shook hands with family friends, he told a surprising amount of people about a dental procedure he recently had. My brother was there with his new girlfriend---new to us, maybe not so new to him? hard to tell, he keeps things pretty well vague---and my dad was ever the gentleman.

It was the last time I'd see him this way, healthy, as himself.

***

The next day, a Sunday, the Browns were beating the Patriots, and I was trying not to care, which was impossible, I cared immensely. It was week nine of the football season, and the Browns had been terrible through eight weeks, the Patriots had been much better, yet here we were in bizarro world with the Browns running away with the thing. It sucks. It’s the worst. It's only sports, and yet it burns my nerves with a thousand fires of anguish and disappointment. At least they’re not losing to the Jets.

I like the Patriots, and I love football. When they lose, I sulk. When they win, I start getting anxious for next week. Such is the cycle of NFL fan me.

I was doing a good job of hiding my displeasure at the 34-14 final score. The Patriots, future playoff team, lost big time to the Browns, cellar dwellers, and I was keeping it together rather well. There would be more football to take my mind off of things, it was only Week Nine, and I was sleepy. So I took a nap.

***

Unlike most people my generation and younger, I have a distant relationship with my phone. I tolerate it; it tolerates me. Ours is a bond of necessity and not much else. I rarely send texts, I refuse to pay for data, and my friends know me well enough to understand that I don’t ever really enjoy phone calls. Talking on the phone is anathema, like guessing another person’s whereabouts or reaching your hand into a garbage disposal. My distaste is to the point that I have added talking on the phone to my yearly to-stop-doing list. My perfect year involves receiving notes and contact solely through email and the off chance that someone runs into me in a Best Buy.

So it was odd that I happened to check my phone that Sunday afternoon. I left it in my church pants when I changed clothes that morning, and I just so happened to find myself in the closet, grabbing some things. My cell phone was one of those things.

Three missed calls. All from my mother.

She calls me often, but three times in a Sunday afternoon? Something was up. I don’t consider myself clairvoyant by any means, but this missed-call trio had me feeling uncomfortable. Worst case scenario, I thought, something happened to some distant relative and she wanted me to hear it from her before someone else.

I called her back immediately.

“Hi, Kevan.”

My stomach hit the floor. Her voice was shaky, trembling. I started trembling. I could sense that bad news was on its way---bad, bad news, some kind of emergency. I can’t recall exactly what was said next---my dad was in the hospital, the doctors were running some tests, we should come to the hospital, she’ll tell me more when we got there. I don’t remember the exact words, but I do remember the feeling I had.

My hand shook as it held the cell phone.

My body filled with so much adrenaline, from head to toe. I could have lifted a car. I could have won a strongman competition. I could have run to the hospital that’s how badly I wanted to get there.

“I’ll tell you more when you get here,” she said.

After I hung up the phone, I was a mess of jitters.We had to get there right away. I told Lindsay that something had happened to my dad and that my mom didn’t want to tell me over the phone. I’m sure my face was completely pale, like I had seen a ghost making a pizza in our kitchen and giving me a thumbs down, so she leapt into action right along with me. We buzzed around the house like bees with their heads cut off, grabbing what we hoped were the car keys and our jackets and our shoes. I don’t know what we grabbed, to be honest. I guess one of them had to be car keys because we got the car started. I remember standing in the doorway to the garage while LL got her stuff together, and I was very nearly running in place. My feet were tapping on the hardwood, and I clutched my arms around my chest, hugging myself to keep from exploding. What could be wrong with my dad? I tried not to let the question consume my mind, but ... but ... Hurry up, we’ve got to go!

We climbed in the car now, Lindsay at the wheel because I would be a danger to myself and others. While we raced the 15 miles to Boise, I thought about the future---the long-term future of what disease would look like for our family, the short-term future of how soon this hospital excursion---a false alarm or something so treatable or cancer, cancer, cancer---would be behind us, the super short-term future of this car, inching along the freeway at 70 miles per hour, a slow blur, a still race. A race to the unknown.

Lindsay reached across the console with an open hand. I closed mine around hers. The world closed around us.

***

We arrived at the hospital in a scattered mess. Is there any other way to arrive at a hospital? I was nervous pushing the elevator buttons to the third floor. We both were. My dad was hospital sick, whatever that meant. He was sick enough that we couldn't talk about it over the phone with my mom, we had to talk in person, with our serious Ryan Gosling faces on and our heads nodding in understanding tones.

I didn't have time to consider how odd it was that I was in a hospital. My family does not do hospitals, not out of principal or anything like that but rather because we have always been so healthy. My darkest hospital memory was the waiting room of the ER when I was twelve years old and my parents got in a car accident. They were fine---my dad got a couple stitches, my mom asked for the stretcher for a possible neck injury that turned out to be nothing---and we were fine. The NBA Finals were on TV, so I had something to do while we bided our time. It was not exactly difficult.

But this visit? Now? I was a speedwalking wreck. I could not get to his room fast enough.
The elevator doors opened, we turned the corner toward the hall, and there was my mom. My mom met us, and we knew.

3. 

I burst into his room, sailing to his bedside. My nerves were stovetop popcorn. It was just so good to see him.

“Hi, Daddy.”

“Hi, Kevy!”

He was excited to see me and had more energy and more vim than I expected him to have. The room was dimly lit, like a dream. My dad had looked very much still like himself, but something had changed. His demeanor was exuberant, nearly frantic. He was without inhibition, holding me close and telling me how much he loved me, how happy he was to see me, big important serious compassionate things that I always knew inherently were true of our relationship and now were being recited to me in an urgent cadence and a warm hug.

Lindsay was next. He held her and told her all sorts of tender, caring truths about the way he felt.

These were the first moments with a dad I didn’t know. A kind and caring and thoughtful dad, just like the dad of my previous 28 years, yet somehow different. Subtly transformed, he looked so familiar and felt so close, and if I had a good minute or two to talk myself out of overreacting, I could have convinced myself nothing had changed at all, that we weren't in a hospital, that I wasn't sitting on a hospital bed, that this wasn't a Jell-o cup but a bag of peanut M&M's fresh from the refrigerator just the way my dad liked them. Yet it was Jell-o. It was a hospital. And my dad, for as much as I wished he weren't, was different.

He was no longer in control.

The dad I knew so well was, for the most part, gone away. He’d come by in glimpses every now and then, in a knowing smile or a confident wink. Otherwise, I was experiencing the new version of him with some of the same loving characteristics - relieved to be with family, deeply kind and caring, trying like mad to take care of everyone in the room however he could which in this case meant telling everyone how much he loved them.

***

In those first few hours with my father in a hospital bed, I got very good at playing mind games. I successfully tricked myself into believing anything, typically the most optimistic anythings, always confident that whatever it was that pinned down my dad couldn’t be that bad. It was a misunderstanding, an overreaction to a very fixable problem, a fluke that aspirin and ice cream could cure.

I believed these things, just as sure as I believed the floor would hold me. I believed that my dad had nothing worse than a migraine headache, caused by something entirely fixable. The mind games were the only thing keeping the terrors at bay. For I knew what dark possibilities existed for him---for us---and I fought like mad to stave them off. He could have a headache or he could have cancer. One possibility gave me peace, the other possibility sent me spinning into madness.

And still I had to fight the slippery slope of possibilities constantly. The darkest option was never far from my mind. What if it was cancer? What would that mean for him? What would that mean for us? What would that mean for me? I’d get the answer soon enough.

My dad’s doctor was the exact type of person you’d want to give you bad news. Dr. Jutzy was round and jolly, a Santa in scrubs. He spoke with a knowing confidence about all our possibilities, answering patiently and honestly every time we asked, "But it could be nothing, right?" He laid all the options out there, matter-of-factly and then, as if sensing that my family had God's promises in our back pocket, tied it all in to faith and prayer and why bad things, bad cancer things, happen to good people.

As wonderful as he was to work with, none of that mattered when it came time to hear my dad’s diagnosis the next morning. Nothing mattered but that life-changing MRI. The family---me, Lindsay, my mom, brother and girlfriend---gathered around a nurse’s computer in the hallway outside my dad’s hospital room. Dr. J pulled up the MRI on the screen.

There it was.

White, sick, enormous - the ugliest scourge of a golf ball I’d ever seen. The tumor was all I could notice on the screen, it was so large and stark - solid white death against a sea of healthy black. Dr. J began explaining the scan to us, and I looped in and out of focus while I stared bewildered at the ball of cancer in my dad’s head. I caught enough words to be dangerous. “Cancer.” “Glioblastoma.” “Astrocytoma.” “Stage IV.”

And I crumpled.

I crumpled up against the wall behind me, collapsing into the plaster, wishing it would envelop me. It was complete and utter shock. My body froze, and fell. I curled my arms around my chest and held tight. Lindsay wrapped her arms around mine. We wept.

We wept because the scans confirmed our deepest fears. I saw on screen the worst case scenario that I wouldn’t allow myself to believe, that I trusted I would never have to confront, but there it was. Plain as day. Black and white - too much white. My mind bounced from horror to horror---what will happen to my dad, do people recover from this, how did it happen, why did it happen---and I kept coming back to that word: cancer. I’d never had to deal so directly with it before, and seeing it up close and personal broke me. I broke right there at the nurse’s station, up against the wall, with my arms holding me together and LL holding me up. I thought about my dad, and my heart broke for him. What must it be like to receive the news that there is cancer in your brain? That there is cancer anywhere, really? The thought of this horrible disease was nearly matched in its awfulness by the thought of my dad being scared. Fathers, in my experience, were not made to fear, and I’m not sure mine had ever. Cancer had come, and he couldn't control it. He couldn't do a thing about it except pray and hope and wish and trust, surgery, chemo, radiation, and wait.

Lindsay and I remained, crumpled in the hallway, as Dr. J and my mom returned to tell my dad. I didn't go any nearer. I couldn't.

***

And here lies the prayers for healing.

So much for my fervent prayers that things wouldn’t have come to this, that it would all be a big misunderstanding or a royal prank, that we’d be walking out of the hospital one day later going, “Whew, that was a close one.” I prayed sincerely, honestly, deeply for healing of my dad, and I got skunked. I remember the prayers vividly. One, I was driving not far from my house on the way to the hospital, which is the only way I really went those first few days. I was passing the fall colors down Roosevelt Avenue, and I prayed. I asked God to heal my dad. I asked politely. I got emotional and a little misty-eyed, and I passed the country mile choking back tears. Two, I was on the freeway to the hospital, speeding at 70 miles per hour with tears streaming down my face. I was a nervous wreck and a literal wreck waiting to happen, but I didn’t mind. It felt good to cry. It felt good to plead with God for a favor, to ask Him for something I felt I was due. That I had loaned God a VHS and here I came to collect. I felt that God could, God should grant us this one because my dad had done so much good for so many people throughout his life. It made perfect sense to me that a miracle was in order.

I prayed and begged and pleaded. I laid it all out there on the table, in tears on the freeway, choking up through the neighborhoods.

And I believed I was going to get my wish.

I was certain that all of this cancer talk would be gone tomorrow. My dad would be healed miraculously, and we’d all go back to living our lives. The doctors would find that it wasn’t all that bad, and he’d be out of the hospital by the weekend. I prayed everything the right way - “whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.” I believed the stuffing out of it.

And when the time came to open Door Number Three and show me my grand prize of a healthy father and saved future and all the happy outcomes I’d longed for, the door stuck. The room sank. The ceiling came down, the crowd split, and there we were, picking up the pieces of ourselves and our lives and wondering where things went wrong. And why.

***

It’s not fair, of course.

If I were in charge, death and cancer would occur by committee. Those who live loving, compassionate lives would be among the last to get picked for disease duty. They’d make a compelling case for being last, fancy PowerPoint presentation, coordinated light show, branded soda coozies for the judges. You couldn’t help but be on their side, couldn’t help but give them a standing ovation when they turn to the final slide with the Venn diagram of integry, faithfulness, and compassion with their profile picture in the middle intersection.

Why do bad things happen to good people? Eventually I was bound to come around to this one. Cancer isn’t fair. My dad’s story isn’t fair.

Why?

Five years later, I still don't have the ultimate answer and maybe never will. But I've been picking up clues. In A Boy and His Horse, C.S. Lewis tells the story of a young man who deals with some of these big questions of Why. Why must others suffer. Why him. Why her. Why not him, or her.

And being very tired and having nothing inside him, he felt so sorry for himself that the tears rolled down his cheeks. What put a stop to all this was a sudden fright. Shasta discovered that someone or somebody was walking beside him. It was pitch dark, and he could see nothing. And the Thing (or Person) was going so quietly that he could hardly hear any footfalls. What he could hear was breathing. His invisible companion seemed to breathe on a very large scale …

If the horse had been any good – or if he had known how to get any good out of the horse – he would have risked everything on a breakaway and a wild gallop. But he knew he couldn’t make that horse gallop. So he went on at a walking pace and the unseen companion walked and breathed beside him. At last he could bear it no longer. “Who are you?” he said, scarcely above a whisper.

“One who has waited long for you to speak,” said the Thing. Its voice was not loud, but very large and deep …

“Oh please – please do go away. What harm have I ever done you? Oh, I am the unluckiest person in the whole world!”

Once more he felt the warm breath of the Thing on his hand and face. ”There,” it said, “that is not the breath of a ghost. Tell me your sorrows.”

Shasta was a little reassured by the breath: so he told how he had never known his real father or mother and had been brought up sternly by the fisherman. And then he told the story of his escape and how they were chased by lions and forced to swim for their lives; and of all their dangers in Tashbaan and about his night among the tombs and how the beasts howled at him out of the desert. And he told about the heat and thirst of their desert journey and how they were almost at their goal when another lion chased them and wounded Aravis. And also, how very long it was since he had had anything to eat.

“I do not call you unfortunate,” said the Large Voice.

“Don’t you think it was bad luck to meet so many lions?” said Shasta.

“There was only one lion,” said the Voice.

“What on earth do you mean? I’ve just told you there were at least two the first night, and …”

“There was only one; but he was swift of foot.”

“How do you know?”

“I was the lion.”

And as Shasta gaped with open mouth and said nothing, the Voice continued. “I was the lion who forced you to join with Aravis. I was the cat who comforted you among the houses of the dead. I was the lion who drove the jackals from you while you slept. I was the lion who gave the Horses the new strength of fear for the last mile so that you should reach King Lune in time. And I was the lion you do not remember who pushed the boat in which you lay, a child near death, so that it came to shore where a man sat, wakeful at midnight, to receive you.”

“Then it was you who wounded Aravis?”

“It was I.”

“But what for?”

“Child,” said the Voice, “I am telling you your story, not hers.”

This is all too familiar. It's familiar and yet it’s foreign and alien and gut-wrenchingly awful - I’ve never lost a dad to cancer before, just this one. I’ve never experienced anything so frightening, so real. It’s brand new. It’s terrible.

It’s also way too familiar.

The characters have changed - and quite poor casting if I might say. The story itself is deja vu, a cosmic clerical error it would seem.

Lindsay’s dad was diagnosed with the same cancer, the exact same cancer - brain cancer, glioblastoma, stage IV. He endured two surgeries, two chemos, and lived 24 months longer. He died during Lindsay’s junior year of college, our first year together, months before we were engaged.

The odds of getting glioblastoma are roughly 1 in 100,000. This particular type of brain cancer is the worst of the worst. The name comes from “glio” meaning “many,” and “blastoma” meaning “look out, we’re going to blast through your good health like dynamite through pudding.” Essentially, glioblastoma destroys the brain by growing and expanding at a rapid pace. It sends off tentacles and branches, little search parties on a quest for brain Manifest Destiny. Surgery rarely gets it all. There’s just too much of it, stuffed away in nooks and crannies, waiting for the scalpel leave before carrying on its party crashing.

Stage IV glioblastoma is the maximum stage.

There is no cure, only remedies and prayers.

That such a devastating, specific, rare form of cancer should strike a single person’s life more than once seems the cruelest of lotteries. I collapsed when I heard the news of my dad’s, overcome with sorrow and fear for what was to come. Lindsay collapsed, then relapsed, then collapsed some more. Not only was the potential diagnosis heartbreaking as she thought of my dad, it was a sneaker wave to her memories of what she’d already experienced. She had cancer before her and cancer behind. She saw it happen to her own father and she was on the precipice of seeing it happen again.

We prayed it wouldn’t. We prayed for the best case. But we knew---from personal experience, unfortunately enough---what very likely lay ahead for us all.

***

My initial response to the threat of brain cancer was a desire to become a brain surgeon, which is a little like responding to the rain by wishing to live in the clouds with a hair dryer. It was a pipe dream based on a knee-jerk need to help people. It was too late to help myself, but maybe, just maybe, I could learn how to operate on the brain, save thousands of lives, discover the secret “Do Not Push” button in cancer’s mainframe, eradicate cancer for everyone, and get my picture on a U.S. postage stamp alongside all those great American heroes like FDR and Elvis.

Until then, I could only sit by and watch my world burn.

After my dad's diagnosis, the options laid before us seemed pretty clear. Cut out the tumor in surgery, test it in the lab to see what it is, have a good old laugh that it was---you guys will never believe this---a macaroon and not a tumor, either that or it is  a tumor and it's cancer and we do chemo, radiation, drugs, treatment etcetera.

My mom, my brother, Lindsay, and I said one final good-bye to my dad in the surgery ward, hugging him for what we hoped wouldn't be the last time. We left, and I went to the hallway to cry. The walls there were just so comfortable.

Then we sat and waited. For hours that felt like eons, we waited, not quite knowing what to do with ourselves. Others had come to visit us, to sit and wait with us, and I was happy to have them and not at all sure what to say. I'm bad at entertaining guests when I'm a whole person, much worse when I'm halved. The corner of the room called to me; there were hideouts behind partitions and half-walls in the waiting room. I fidgeted for a few hours under the fluorescent lights, imagining what the others in the room were there for. Did their dads have cancer? Were they waiting for a routine procedure or a life-saving one? Shouldn't we all be wearing name tags or color-coded hard hats so we know each other's situations?

Then as my thoughts were wandering away---a nice reprieve, actually---they came running back. Dr. Jutzy was finished.

He called us into a side room and my family sat and listened. He had got as much of the tumor as he could, the surgery was successful, my dad was alive and in recovery and he'd be talking and living and breathing among us again in no time.

Also, the tumor was cancer. It was so much like all the other tumors Dr. Jutzy had excised in the past. He recognized it like you'd recognize a neighbor, a neighbor who borrowed your things and never returned them, a neighbor you tried real hard to avoid.

We'd of course still send the tumor out to the lab to confirm what it was, just to make sure, just to give hopeful folks like me a few more days to imagine that maybe, maybe my dad's tumor looked exactly like cancer but was actually benign. Yes, sure, I could envision that happening and the wonderful relief of the phone call telling us it was nothing. And yet, I felt my faith withering a bit. The hopeful possibility grew more transparent. I could nearly see through it as if it never really existed.

My brightest memory from summer camp is of socks. For some reason known only to 4th-grade me, I was determined to wear my velcro sandals everywhere, to everything. I wore these sandals with socks, and as the day came to a close, I could look down and see that my socks had grown six inches. They grew longer and dirtier, browner and wetter, by the hour, dependably enough to tell time. They dangled off the front of the sandals, they flapped limply, oddly, weirdly as I walked. My socks grew throughout the day, as I ran and jumped and played (but never showered) until they had morphed into a clapping flag of my nerdiness. I neither felt embarrassed of nor sad about those socks. They just were. I had other things to be sad about.

Camp, for me, did not go the way I expected or intended.

I did not love it. I despised it. I wanted it to end just as quickly as possible---or quicker, if my ride could get there.

But you know the one thing that made the waiting bearable? I knew that it would all be over on Friday afternoon. I could count down the days, hours, and minutes until my parents arrived with the Chevy Suburban of salvation. I think I literally did count it down.

I survived, knowing that the end was in sight.

You cannot do the same with cancer. You can survive, sure, but you’ll have to find another way to do it besides counting it down in your head. There is no end for cancer. It is not over on Friday afternoon when your SUV of hugs and snacks comes rolling onto the campground.

You sit and wait.

You hope for the best.

You have absolutely, completely no idea when it will be over.

This thought washed over me one day as I was driving the freeway back to the hospital. I was speeding past the 24-hour animal clinic on the interstate, which is neither notable nor significant but just a mile marker of a memory.

I could handle this if I knew I only had to make it four more days, I told myself. Or even 4 more weeks. Four months? Eh, that’s pushing it. But ok, four more months. Just let there be a finish date.

Let the Suburban come. Pass out the hugs and snacks. It had been three days and I was ready for camp to be over, just like I was already for camp to be over, ready to head back home.

"Things aren't ever going to be the same, are they?"

Ugh.

Erg.

Arrrgh.

At some point in the journey of grief, things are going to get despicably real. You will look around at those of you lucky enough to be spared from horrible disease and recognize the new horrible that becomes life without your loved one. It's a sinking feeling, like you're falling, falling, you notice that you're falling, you flap your arms like a fleshy bird, you blow toward the ground like a cartoon coyote, you pull out all the stops until you finally turn to your last resort of just admitting that you're tumbling through the sky as helpless as can be and you're just going to have to learn to get used to it.

"Things aren't ever going to be the same."

There's no turning back. Once you catch a glimpse of the final score, there's no going back. Once you see your pastor in shorts or your dentist at the mall or your best friend doing drugs, there's no coming back from that. The millisecond after cancer strikes, you are changed forever---in many ways for the good, in other ways for the worse.

And somewhere along the way you end up admitting that. Once the adrenaline slows and you stop to breathe. Once you stop your antic nerves long enough to think.

We were sitting in the hospital's cafeteria when reality sunk in. My mom said the words---"Things aren't ever going to be the same"---not that she wanted to have a conversation about them but more just to say them. To let me know that she knew. She said them as if once she did, the great administrative assistant in the sky could get the paperwork started on this new, strange life of ours.

I don't know when I would have said it if she hadn't gone first. When I heard the words come out of her mouth, as we held hands side-by-side in a booth on the day after his surgery, I wanted to say, "Of course things will stay the same! He'll come out of this just fine. Everything is going to be okay." But that wasn't anywhere close to the truth, and I knew it from the moment my instinct to please wore off. He very well could have been just fine following surgery, recovery, and treatment, but you don't endure a cancer experience like we were and not come out a completely changed family.

Things won't ever be the same.

***

When I think about how long I’ve been grieving---not that I need to write it on a questionnaire or survey or anything---I count the time from the moment that illness struck, not the moment my dad left.

You grieve when the person you love changes. You lose something that you have held dear for so long, seeing it replaced with this stranger you didn’t ask for or wish for. Grieving is so often associated with death, but death is just one source, a final source. We grieve the ones we lose, even if we’re losing certain versions of that person. I grieved my dad’s strength, care, and super powers the day he was diagnosed with cancer. He could have lived by miracle of miracles but there still would have been loss. There still would have been grief. There was, in fact, lots more to come of both, and I started the clock from the moment I heard the news.

There’s a popular sentiment that I clung to when I began the grief process: There’s no wrong way to grieve. This gets translated to “everyone grieves in their own way,” which often ends up feeling like “you grieve alone.”

You do grieve alone, to a certain extent. You grieve when the grief arrives, and the grief rarely calls ahead. Your bad days come and go on whims, arriving like flash floods to drench you while the rest of the world goes about its day with nothing but clear skies. The clear skies will come for you, too. Sometimes they come so early on that you’re unprepared, still wearing your rain slicker and straining to not move on too quickly. You’ll get caught off guard by a memory that doesn’t turn you to puddles, and you’ll wonder why you’re not puddling - am I that callous? am I that forgetful? am I that horribly detached from reality that I’ve already moved on? No, no, and no.

You never move on, by the way. You move sideways. You change tracks. Life lurches forward, and you find yourself choosing a new path, like a fork in the road with a million tines. Depending on your level of loss, your choice could come quickly or take ages, your path could be adjacent to your previous one or it could be a world away.

Loss changes you. Grief resolves you. Love guides you. Hold tight and hold strong, and you’ll find a new path to lurch down.

“I want to stop being brave, stop being in control, stop having affairs, stop thinking that I will ever understand the purpose and intricacies of human life. I want to stop having a father who might have cancer. I even want my father to die sometimes, just to get it over with. I want to die before anyone in my family, or Kathleen, or Megan dies. I don’t ever want to die, and I don’t want to play anymore.”
- Anne Lamott, Hard Laughter



With my dad home from the hospital and feeling strong after a few months of recovery, Lindsay and I decided to do a mad, wonderful, irreversible thing. We decided to become parents.

I've come to realize that you are never ready to become a parent, and if you ever are, it is too late and you are too old because it takes a lifetime of preparedness and maturity to see parenthood as anything other than impossible.

We had a kid, and I wasn’t ready. Being ready, of course, was never part of the plan. I jumped into fatherhood feet first without looking. Here we were, Lindsay and I, living large as a pair of untethered twentysomethings, nothing to tie us down other than bills and work and insurance and groceries. You can drop a bill on its head and not feel terrible. You get three weeks of vacation a year from work, and you can quit whenever it gets hard. You can buy Cheetos for your groceries.

Things change with kids, but this wasn’t nearly a strong enough notion to alter our decision. We chose to have kids in the aftermath of my dad’s cancer diagnosis.

We chose to have kids for him, so that he could be a grandpa.

We chose to have kids because life is too short to keep putting it off.

We chose to have kids and never looked back.

We chose to have kids during the most difficult time of our lives, maybe to bring some joy and happiness back into our equation, to balance out the numerator of cancer with the newness of life. They’d cancel each other out, right? We did not come by the decision lightly, though we certainly got there fast. It was as if both of us felt this enormous momentum toward doing the most significant thing we could think of right then and there. We had zero doubt that the decision was the right one, even though our circumstance seemed so wrong. We were in grief and shock and mourning, and we struck back with the biggest response we could.

We had a baby, you guys. A real baby that eats and eats and never sleeps and poops and scoots and laughs and looks deep into your eyes with the silliest and sincere love and adoration.

If I felt my life spinning out of control prior to kids, then the birth of our son hit the accelerator. I was less in control than ever. Lindsay was less in control. In fact, the person with the most control was probably Evan, the baby.

Evan arrived, and my dad was there to see it. My dad and mom came over to the house when we arrived back from the birthing center. We took photos of all of us together, and my dad and Evan specifically. There's one I cherish with my dad on our couch, arms folded across his chest and Evan sleeping on top. My dad is looking down at Evan with a proud, disbelieving smile, just as he'll look down on him now and forever.

Evan's arrival was the smartest reckless thing we did during my dad's illness. It was the smartest thing we may have done, period. Not that I saw any of these wonderful moments happening the way they did. Early on in the pregnancy, I made a list of the hopes and fears I had with starting a family. I wrote down silly heavy things like "Having a baby will make me confront my mortality" and "Why bring a person into this world to experience pain at some point?" I was in a bad place, obviously. My mind was jaded to the things of this world, and I wondered why anyone would choose to bring more people in.

Of course, I was wrong. It's a good thing, I've realized, to confront my mortality. It's inevitable that people will experience pain---and it's not worth missing out on all the good, the fun, the meaningful just to save a few hard knocks.





***

I have a son of my own now. A preposterously gleaming boy, a pile of laughs and questions. He’s old enough now to have long conversations with me, often about trains and sometimes about life. And he’s old enough to have formed an opinion of me as I formed of opinion of my dad: a superman, a joke machine, a security blanket, a best bud, and a rock.

I wasn’t sure how things were going to go there. Evan was a newborn after my dad was diagnosed. He spent his first nine months in this world, riding shotgun to the most emotional, tragic, heartfelt, gut-wrenching days of my life. I did my best to compartmentalize. I stuffed my sad emotions into compartments that I only ever opened when I was alone---lying awake in bed with what-ifs dancing in my mind, driving the car to work and back while thinking of my dad and asking why.

Those last nine months with my dad would have been far sadder without my son. I would have been more visually devastated, more dejected, more this-sucks-i’m-eating-doritos-now.

With Evan around, I forced out the smiles, and wouldn’t you know, forcing the smiles gives the real ones an act to follow. It’s easy to not take the time to sit and think about real things - real sad things in particular - when life is whizzing by, and life rarely whizzes by any faster than when you drop a new kid onto it. Our life was spinning, twisting, tilting out of control, and we hung on to Evan, to each other, to my mom and dad with all that we had, and I could feel my grip coming undone. You can’t hold on forever, no matter how slow or fast the ride is going.

Sometimes, it’s just time to get off. To find a new ride. To buy a churro and go home.

Sorrow comes in great waves...but it rolls over us, and though it may almost smother us it leaves us on the spot and we know that if it is strong we are stronger, inasmuch as it passes and we remain. It wears us, uses us, but we wear it and use it in return; and it is blind, whereas we after a manner see.
- Henry James

My high school football team used to gather every Saturday morning to watch film of Friday night’s game, laughing at big hits and missed tackles, scarfing doughnuts at coach’s house and not really taking any of it seriously. There I’d be on the big screen, snapping the ball to the quarterback, then doing my job - and little more than my job - until the play was past me and I could be absolved of blame. I was technically brilliant with my blocking and terribly weak with my strength. This was good enough to be one of my team’s better players.

Very rarely did we watch film of next week’s opponent. Only sometimes did we have any idea what we were up against.

During my sophomore year, we were on the road for the playoffs, and we were playing a team from the other side of the state, a side peppered with small towns and farmland and wide open spaces where there was little else to do but work hard, grow muscles, and knock each other around on a football field. We didn’t watch tape for this opponent, but oh did we hear stories. The kids were giants, they were cedars, they were space elevators a mile wide with Goliath arms and Andre the Giant moves and Mr. Hyde manners. They would spare no expense or cheap shot to get an edge. I bought a flack jacket, a wrap-around corset of hard plastic to protect your ribs, because of the legends of sucker punching in the trenches.

I had a vision for what was going to end me.

Jump over to your health, and it's the same story. You might study up and try your best, but when crunch time arrives and you're faced with the world's thickest opponent, only then do you realize what you're in for.

You don’t recover from glioblastoma. Many cancers you never recover from.

So when you get that diagnosis, the doctor is doing introductions for the disease that will kill you. Eventually. Sooner or later. Unless something radical or accidental happens between now and then, terminal cancer---brain, colon, prostate, etc.---will be what does you in.

How surreal it must be to know what is going to kill you. How upsetting to have a ticking time bomb in your body, rumbling around at a simmer or a full boil, depending on the day. How reassuring, maybe, that you’ve met your match and now the two of you can get to know each other, or you can give your match the what’s what and tell it to take a hike, or you can stick your fingers in your ears and sing showtunes at great decibels to drown out the death watch, or you can keep on living your life, knowing there’s nothing you can do about it.

I imagine it’s all of those things---surreal, upsetting, reassuring---and that ultimately, many who get these types of cancers find it pointless to dwell on what’s going to kill you and focus instead on what’s going to make you feel alive.

***

I register these thoughts and feelings as just that - thoughts and feelings - because I never did ask my dad about any of it.

Brain cancer changes you. All cancer changes you, but brain cancer especially has the odd, awful side effect of potentially disrupting the usually healthy parts of your brain and making emotions and attitudes and deep thinking and conversations hard.

Some people who get brain cancer experience fundamental changes to their mood, becoming a sadder or meaner or more emotional version of themselves than they’d ever been before.

Others experience cognitive differences---forgetting names, struggling to problem solve, struggling to think clearly or accurately or sensibly about certain things.

Communication comes and goes. Aphasia, not being able to verbally articulate what you are thinking, gets worse. Speech dissolves. The wrong words tumble out.

My dad experienced all of this. He experienced it to varying degrees and in various stages. It began with names. He couldn't say the names he saw so clearly in his head. He became hesitant to talk about anything serious, preempting conversations by asking, "So you think I'm going to die in a few days?" We learned to speak his new language of which foods he wanted to eat (macaroni and cheese), which activities he wanted to do (go for a drive), and which people he wanted to see (Evan).

It got harder and harder to communicate with him just at the point where all I wanted in the whole wide world was to sit down and have a conversation with my dad. I wanted him to tell me that everything was okay. I wanted to hear him say that he wasn't afraid to die. I wanted him to give me permission to stop trying to hold everything together and to just let things be.







***

I didn't talk to anyone about much of anything. Lindsay and I had this telepathic connection where we each knew what the other was feeling. Since we had gone through all this before, we knew---she was me and I was her but all the same feelings and pain were lying out on the table. I didn't need to tell her that, boy, it sure sucks to think that Evan won't have grandpas, because Lindsay was having the though, too. I didn't have to tell her that I feel alone an awful lot, that Father's Day sure is tough, and that today's been a Ben-and-Jerry's kind of day, because she already knew.

My mom stays faithfully by my dad's side, every day. We don't get much time to talk about much of anything other than the conversations that try to stay upbeat and hopeful and positive. It's not ideal, but then again, nothing with cancer is.

So it happened that I got some alone time with my mom for what felt like the first time in forever. We drove to a show in Boise - Fiddler on the Roof - and we had the whole 20-minute car ride to talk about our feelings and all the unspoken thoughts and fears and ideas that we'd kept private for the past month.

This was my big chance. I could finally say all the heavy things that were weighing me down. I could ask all my questions and hang my heart on the line to dry out. It gets so soggy holding onto all these thoughts. I'd tell my mom I loved her, that I was simply amazed by how she's held things together and how she's cared for my dad. I'd tell her that none of this is her fault. I'd tell her that all of this is stupid and I hate it. I'd tell her I love her, again and again.

I started in.

I choked up.

One or two words escaped at a time and the rest was heaves. I couldn't bring myself to say anything; my throat was a desert, and I was fighting back tears and sniffing away a breakdown.

I kept it together, but I kept silent. I failed.

I couldn't even talk about my dad when the situation was perfect to talk about it. It was my one opportunity to say whatever was on my mind---to take a burden off the Atlassian stack on my back, and when I started from the top of my to-talk-about list, I got one sentence in, felt the emotion strangle me and the tears on deck, and I shut things down. I was toast.

I looked across at my mom and said I'm sorry. Her brown eyes met mine, and in them, I had all my answers. We had our conversation in the blink of an eye.

In a glance, she understood everything.


7. 

My dad answered the phone after my breakup with the only girlfriend who didn't become my wife. I was distraught, as a 20-year-old college kid could be, losing a relationship I thought I enjoyed quite a bit with a girl I thought had liked me.

I phoned home. My dad answered.

He had the chance to meet this girl when he and my mom visited a few weeks before. We went out to dinner together, talked, laughed, had a great time. Turns out, as I'd find out several months later, my dad was not high on this girl at all. My mom, who is high on everyone, liked her enough not to say anything bad, which is basically her version of a no-go. My parents didn't think this girl was right, and they would have never let me know this.

I called home when we broke up (fine, when she broke up with me). And my dad's advice: "Well, maybe you'll get back together later on."

It was terrible advice, and I'm certain he neither believed it nor wanted it to happen. Nevertheless, somehow some way he must have known it was exactly what I needed to hear---me, who has a hard time letting go of anything, who fears change, who runs from rejection, who would rather fantasize about the .01 percent of things going the way I want (even in the face of raw evidence saying there's no way I should ever want this at all) than to face the reality of heartache and sadness. I took the advice hook, line, and sinker. Of course we'll get back together, I told myself. Love is real and relationships are magic! It made me feel better and hopeful if just for a minute or two, which was the first time I had felt either feeling all evening.

***

Another phone call from college stands out to me, too. And yet again, I phoned, bearing awkward news.

See, my brother and I could do no wrong in my dad's eyes. We were high achievers, legends, heroes to him. He was a hero to me, and it worked in reverse.

I went to college, he didn't. I found white-collar work, he went a different route. I excelled in school with good grades and good sports and good friends and zero problems whatsoever. He hadn't.

But even more than that, his pride in me and my brother grew out of a love and care for us as people. I could have been terrible at sports (in hindsight, I may have been). I could have got into trouble in school or chose the wrong friends or dropped out of college or any number of other missteps, and it wouldn't have changed his tune one bit. He loved us unconditionally, even when we called him from college and told him strange stuff.

I went a circuitous route through college. I started at a school in my hometown, a private school where I landed a full-ride scholarship. And after one year of it, I drove off. I left for a school in Seattle, a school more expensive than the first and with no full-ride scholarship in my pocket. And then, late in my sophomore year of college, I called my dad to tell him I wanted to ditch my accounting major and study journalism. I wanted to ditch this sure thing I had going and try on something highly unusual but really, really fun for me.

Always the practical planner, my dad certainly saw the security and income I was giving up by dropping accounting. He certainly had no idea---nor did I---about how one makes much money with a journalism degree.

And yet he was cool with it.



His response to all the change: pride. Happiness. An interest in knowing that I was pursuing something I enjoyed and doing something that made me feel fulfilled.

Thankfully, I stopped the weird phone calls at two. I'd been dumped, and I'd dramatically changed course in my life. And I was right in the same spot I'd always been, on my dad's pedestal.

***

I think I may have been a late bloomer, emotionally. All the Big Questions of the world didn't enter my radar until the last few years when, bad timing on my part, my dad wasn't able to answer.

Take death, for instance.

What did he think would happen to him when he died?

Did he fear death?

How had he prepared for it?

Was there anything he had left to do?

I could rattle off questions for hours. There'd never be answers, though. I was too late.

My dad didn't want to have those conversations, for every time I tried to do so, it became an odd discourse in whether or not we were telling him he was dying (the ultimate no-no in the house, even if it were true). If I asked him about what he wanted to do in the next few months, there was just no easy of way of keeping the question from sounding like he only had a few months left.

And the topic itself, he made clear that he wasn't interested in discussing.

And even if he were able to discuss, would the answers have truly been his own?

Brain cancer does weird things to your thoughts, ideas, and communication. Even if were able to carry the conversation, it could have been different than what he really believed or thought or felt. Who knew what kind of answers I'd be getting if I was to talk to a man about death whose imminent death was due to a problem where the processing, deep thinking, and vital stuff happens.

So, no, I didn't get to talk much to my dad about all this.

I don't regret any of it.

I'm just not sure who to ask now.

Living near cancer is a daily exercise in pranking yourself. You tell yourself one thing; reality is another. You tell your gullible self that everything will be okay, meanwhile cancer is TPing your future.

I swear I had this whole thing figured out, battened down, groovy. As soon as I landed in a comfort zone, here came cancer with its bag of tricks and a snorting laugh.

Though I certainly didn’t consider myself an emotionally stable person through much of this experience, I did seem to largely have control over my bouts of crying. I didn’t cry in public. I didn’t cry on the regular around family. When I cried, it was likely due to the Hoover Dam of emotions inside me---a Hoover Dam to end all Hoover Dams---filled to overflowing and then some, and out would come the tears.

This time, the tears took me by surprise.

We were sitting in Dr. Jutzy’s office for a followup visit, long enough after my dad’s surgery, chemo, radiation, and recovery that I had built some sort of haphazard semblance of this new life and had thought it looked okay to me. I had grown comfortable with the state of things, if not fully accepting of all of it.

My dad’s condition had been deteriorating slightly, perhaps only to those of us who saw him on a daily basis and heard tell of all his small missteps and communication problems.

And then, all of a sudden, here was Dr. Jutzy telling us that the cancer had come back. Plain as day, just as it always does, didn't you all - especially you, Kevan, who seems to have his act together so well - know this was coming?

So there I sat in tears, fully aware that my sworn duty was to maintain a brave face yet fully incapable of doing so, even in the slightest. I wasn’t bawling. I was fighting back the tears with all I had, but they were just rushing too fast and furious, as if someone had spilled a bucket of golf balls in the street and I was scrambling to pick up every one.

Dr. Jutzy told us how the time had come to consider moving over to a radiation doctor and an oncologist, a tumor institute where people go to blast the living daylights out of these demon tentacles and to hope for the best.

He turned and asked me if I had any questions. Questions? I had millions, billions, the “why” category alone could fill libraries. Questions? I couldn’t get a single one out, even the appropriate, logistical ones. I was too busy sniffing tears away and straining to see the room through my soppy, red eyes.

I still couldn’t really talk after we left his office. None of us really could, although my mom and dad had been able to keep back the waterworks a whole lot better than I had. We went to eat hamburgers and french fries around the corner. We sat and looked at each other, chatted every so lightly and difficultly, and looked at each other some more, as if we couldn’t even be sure this was the real us sitting at the table. Had our lives been replaced with drama actors? Were we in a virtual reality version of an Oscar movie where the good guys get cancer and the bad guys get away? This couldn’t be us. Could it?

How do people do it?

How do they sit around expecting miracles to happen when cold, hard facts are plain-as-day  in front of their face?

And what’s wrong with me for not being more like these people?

My dad’s cancer is one that you do not recover from. Glioblastoma arrives, dawdles, destroys. You can incise it and blast it and send it into remission, and it will always come back to finish the job.

There’s no getting around this biological fact.

Then there’s the side of faith, where anything is  possible, miracles happen, and people are healed. Straight up healed! Cured! And all it takes is a little mustard seed of trust.

What am I supposed to believe exactly?

When facing terrible health trouble like this, you often hear of people praying for miracles and that those involved should have faith that God can heal. Have faith that God can heal. My loose translation: Have faith that God will take this cancer away and that the doctors, after they've performed the surgery and ran the tests, will call us into the office and say, “Well sheesh, this is strange. I can’t explain it at all, but your dad’s cancer is gone. He’s completely healed.” That’s the kind of faith I’m expected to have?

Can you even imagine?

I can. I took this route when my dad fell ill. In his first couple days in the hospital, the official diagnosis had yet to be made as we waited for the pathology results. We wouldn’t know for sure if it was cancer and, if so, how bad of cancer it was until after surgery. I took this window of uncertainty and burst through it.

I let myself believe with all of my heart that my dad did not have cancer. That when the doctors would get in there and see what it was, we’d all have an amazing come to Jesus moment where it turns out---get this---there was no cancer at all. Just an abscess. Just a smear on the MRI. Go ahead and resume your normal lives.

I expected this result. I longed for this result. I placed all my chips and all my hopes on this result.

And I lost.

It was cancer, sure enough. And not only that, but it was cancer with a capital C and all four stages of the four-stage variety. It was the worst of the worst, the kind that gives you a maximum of years that you can count on half a hand.

I was crushed. My dad had cancer. My dad had cancer even though I was sure that miracles were his destiny. You could barely crush me any more than I already was, or else I’m sure the weight of trauma and disappointment would have wiped me clean off the earth.

So what do we do with this faith versus fact dilemma now?

I did all the right things. I believed in my heart that good news was coming. I prayed fervently and passionately and honestly. I said the magic words!

And yet, and still.

I was in the first inning of the cancer ballgame---they'd barely thrown the first pitch---and I was already getting blown out. It was 100 to nothing in favor of cancer, and my resolve and psyche was in pieces. I had put my faith in a miracle, and I got the exact opposite of what I had believed so sincerely.

How do you recover from that?

I’m not sure that I did.

I spent the rest of my dad’s illness clinging to the new hopes - that his experience with disease would be as soft and comfortable as possible, that we’d make memories over these final years together, that my mom would survive, that I would survive, that Lindsay would survive, that we’d get absolutely as long as possible with him and with as few bad days and bad times and bad moments as possible. I found new ways to hope and new miracles to trust.

I never again felt with certainty that he’d be miraculously healed.

Maybe this was on purpose. Maybe---clearly---it was never in God’s plan to do a miraculous healing job. Maybe I had to learn the hard lesson of what to do when my expectations are tossed asunder in favor of the exact opposite thing that I wanted, needed, and hoped.

Everything happens for a reason, and I believe it. Still. I take great comfort in it, for if I were to give up the ghost and end my search for a reason, all this loss and sorrow would be for naught. My dad can't have had brain cancer for nothing, it can't just have been chance or a fluke that it would come to him and not another. If I stop believing that there was a reason for this whole cold season of life, then I could very well stop believing everything---every major, significant truth about God and goodness and life, every element of love, every reason to live. It'd be gone, if he died for nothing.

And so I search. I hunt for clues. My faith returns to me as I stand convinced that there is a perfectly good explanation for why this all happened.

And as I'm off on the chase, I am comforted.

I feel meaning in my own life as I search for meaning in his. Because he is me. The answer, part of it, is right under my nose, right in this chair as I'm typing these words, it's wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt and house slippers and it's about to go out to the couch to watch a movie with Lindsay. The search for answers to the question of why is likely always to be just that---a search. Yet maybe the search itself is part of the answer.

For in searching, I change. I mature. I heal. In searching for the why, I make the choice to believe that there is a why, and believing in a why is believing that life is bigger than just the sum of its parts, that there is more to it than just random chance or biological consequence. Here I am on a mad hunt for something to hold accountable for my dad's loss, and I my search may very well end with me.

Since my dad got sick, I have changed in fundamental ways. Lindsay has changed. My mom has changed. I have found what matters most to me in life and I have drawn it near. We had our son. Lindsay graduated from college. My mom has traveled the world. We would not be where we are today without the decades spent with the dad of my youth or  the months spent with my dad as he left.



He's gone, and my faith stays around. I search, and I find---crumbs and clues---and in so doing, I become what I seek.

***

That I’m even able to have thoughts and discussions about the role of faith and God in all of this is thanks to my dad. And even that almost didn’t come to be.

My dad took a hard turn for the worse in high school, toward a life of drugs and alcohol and all sorts of things that he’d never tell us boys about.

One night, he was lying in bed in the midst of a drug haze, and the Lord spoke to him. My dad heard the Lord say that he could either die here in his bed tonight or that he could choose to follow Him and never touch drugs again.

He never touched another drug.

He went on to serve in the church, to travel on mission trips, to mentor young men, and to raise me and my brother in a pretty wise way. It was a complete 180, and it changed everything for him. He reconnected with his girlfriend, who became his wife, who became my mom. He got his life on track to own his plumbing business and buy real estate and invest in retirement. He did all these amazing things thanks to that one decision that has reverberated through all of our lives---everyone he met along the way, me, my brother, all we've come in contact with. We are where we are because of him. We'll continue to be for the same.

I found myself driving to an invisible subdivision, one that my mom had claimed was true and tangible and very much a real place that she and my dad had invested in together, yet I could not see a speck of suburbia amid all the boonies. I was doing my best, driving my fastest, scanning the tilled farm fields, straining to see around the rolling hills of corduroy, trusting that the next bend would reveal the mystery.

Where was this subdivision? And why was I hell-bent on visiting?

This subdivision did not exist, nearest I could tell. The subdivision was a lie, and I gobbled it up gladly because I needed an excuse to get out of the house. "Excuse" is putting it mildly. I didn't need an excuse to get out of the house. I had to flee the house for my life, for if I had stayed, I would have gone crazy. I would have eaten the sofa and binged on the drapes. When I made a break for it, I was running from life itself, knowing that escape was futile but still hoping I could make the sun hang in the sky just a little bit longer, to push off tomorrow just a tad.

I drove to the invisible subdivision to clear my head. No, I drove there to get out. I drove there because I had to do something and driving was the only action my brain was capable of processing.

I strapped my six-month-old son into his car seat, and I bombed out of the garage.

Ten minutes before, I received an email from my mom. She communicates most everything via email, including the yucky emotional things. My inbox had been on high alert for months. With my dad on watch with brain cancer, every message from my mom brought with it that brief moment of terror. Is this it? What happened? Why can't her email subject lines be more specific? The email she sent today looked like this:

Subject: Daddy

Dearest Sons Ever,

Brittany Lynn, the PA from MSTI, just called with the preliminary from Daddy's MRI this morning.  The tumor is increasing, and she wants him to start his steroids again to decrease the swelling around it.  She said that would help his speech and his walking, but it may make his face a little puffy.

She wants to move up Dr. Swerdloff's appointment from Monday to tomorrow afternoon at 3:30.  I told her we would want to talk about what to do now with you boys and make sure Daddy feels good about the future plans.  Dr. S. may suggest another chemo or another med, and of course I said some friends want us to try NCD drops.  She said to ask the doctor about how those would interact with whatever med he suggested.

Do you want to be there, or do you want to talk about it sometime this weekend after I get the info?  I also asked her about keeping Kenny comfortable if the tumor continues to grow, and she said that is when the doctor would say to use a hospice agency.  She said that does not mean an end of life, but just lots of help to keep him happy and pain-free at that point.

Daddy is sleeping right now, after enjoying a crisp meat burrito!  He is such a sweet, brave man, who said just this week how much he loves to see his boys when they come over.  Your wives are very precious to him, too, and Evan is icing on the cake!
In the pitch dark of my son Evan's bedroom, rocking him back to sleep in an infinity loop of sways, I found this message on my phone. He was cuddling up to my chest. When I pulled open my mom's email, it must have felt to him like sleeping on the back seat of a New York City taxi, my heart was thumping so hard.

This is not the news we wanted to hear, but we are hanging onto God's faithfulness and asking Him to carry you carefully in His arms, too.  Daddy would want all your plans and dreams and hopes to continue to go forward, as he looks forward to being there for each of your milestones and is so proud of you!

Always loving you and praying for your peace,

Mommy
For the past year-and-a-half, I had majored in linguistic email analysis. I knew in my bones that this was bad news. This email was despair---it was well-hidden despair and my mom was so sweet to try to spare my feelings. But I assumed the worse. I quickened. I panicked. Life slowed as my pulse sped. If only life could have stopped completely and hit rewind.

I had dreaded this day---well, not this day specifically; I had not really feared Email D-Day in my cancer machinations. I had feared the day when my dad's relative good health and decent test results would take a turn for the worse. He had the nastiest of the nasty brain cancers, the one that never gets better, only leads you along on a string of indeterminate length. I feared when the string would end, and with the arrival of this email, I could finally see its fray.

My body tensed with anxiety. My heart pounded. I performed breathing exercises to keep my son from getting whiplash on my chest. My mind raced to a thousand million different conclusions. He would be gone in a month. A week. He would live another five years but the qualify of life would be so low the five years would feel like five hundred. Or he was fine, and I read too much into my mom's emails. The doctor is going to point to me and make me give a speech during the appointment. He's going to make me look at the MRI reading, which I hate doing. Every MRI reminds me of the first, and the first was absolutely shattering. We will all cry. None of us will cry. The doctor will single me out for being the only one not crying among all us grief-stricken family, and I won't have an answer for his pointed questions. He has three months to live, doesn't he? All my thoughts have an Instagram filter. Or take place on the set of a soap opera. I don't know how to hear my dad has only X amount of time to live. How would James Franco, the actor, handle the news?

I needed to go somewhere to clear my mind. When my son awoke a few minutes later, I decided to make my break. He needed more sleep; kids sleep in cars. I needed control; I was losing all of mine.

We strapped in and took off. I had been meaning to visit my dad's subdivision, an out-of-the-way group of homes he had invested in with some business partners. For many years, I knew nothing of its existence; he had started it when I was away at college, and no one remembered to catch me up. The topic came up casually in conversation one day, almost too casually, like someone was pulling a prank on me about my dad's property ownership. If it hadn't been the world's lamest prank, I might not have believed it.

The subdivision was out in the country, several miles from where I lived. The way my mom described it was beautiful. In my mind, it was a picturesque meadow, overlooking the mighty Snake River. Sunsets bathed the plots in the evening; wildlife came in at dusk. The homes were magnificent, epic. They blended into the landscape in such a way as to take away none of the natural beauty of the area. I pictured celebrities moving there. Billy Crystal, maybe. Jude Law.

I had never been to this subdivision, and I had always wanted to. Now seemed like a high time. My grief and terror over this appointment -- not a diagnosis or a surgery, mind you, just a vague visit to the cancer clinic -- made me wistful for my dad, and visiting his subdivision would help me remember him for the way he was, a successful plumber and savvy businessman. I found the place irresistible, even though I had no way to actually find it.

Off we went. Into oblivion.

I drove from memory of my mom's verbal directions until I ended up way out in the country, 15-20 minutes from home. Evan did not fall asleep, as I had hoped. My nerves had not settled. While I drove, I thought. I followed rabbit's holes into dangerous places.

I kept driving, and kept driving. Once we reached the lake, my son started chatting -- harmless coos at first, slowly building into more angry noises. He must have wondered what in the world I was doing with a white-knuckle grip on the wheel and my head turning from side to side, following an imaginary tennis match. His angry cries got louder and more demonstrative until there I was, in the middle of Idaho’s mosaic of beet fields, nearby to nowhere, with a crying child and a broken heart and no clue where I was or what I was doing.

I recognized his sounds as they escalated, and still I drove. Finding the subdivision became my Crusade. Something snapped inside my head that convinced me I must find this subdivision at all cost. Finding the subdivision was the only thing I could control at the moment. I could not control my dad dying from cancer. I could not control what would happen to my family’s future. I could not control tomorrow or anything that came after.

I could control this car.

This madness continued for several more minutes, each more desperate than the last. If I quit now and turned around, I failed, and failure was too finite, too mortal for me to even consider. I was holding the steering wheel with shaking hands, my son screaming at me in the back seat of the car. He was done riding; I was just beginning. We must have looked like quite the production. As cars whizzed by, I knew they could see me singing children showtune ballads, white-knuckled grip on the wheel, my head on a lazy Susan; they could see my son -- they could hear him! -- wailing away in the backseat. They probably thought I'd stolen him. They must have thought I had taken him from somewhere and was going to stash him away in my secret subdivision if only I could remember where I put it.

Finally, I relent.

The subdivision was nowhere. The subdivision was a lie. My quest ended with only a mile to go before the road did. The hill above the river bank meant the end of the line, meant defeat, and I was close enough to see it. I eased the car onto the shoulder, in front of a farmhouse. I stopped the car, got out, and climbed into the back seat to comfort my son.

He was glad to see me, glad to know he was still loved. He also really wanted to be done with this car ride---a car ride that, by the definition of road trips and linear travel, was only half over. We still had to drive back, just as long and unfulfilling as the drive here, to nowheresville.

Maybe we should just stay here, on the shoulder of the road, forever, I thought. We could live in the car and eat whatever ruffage falls out of passing produce trucks. I bet no one got cancer here in the wilderness. I'd have to text my wife directions. Turn left at the invisible subdivision.

I chose not to stay. I chose to go home. This may have seemed like a brave decision, my choosing to face the reaper and take my lumps, but it is not. Bravery is for people who stay to face cancer, not fraidy-cats like me who head for the hills at the sight of a subtext-laden email.

Home is the only place my son can be truly comforted because the backseat, alone, certainly isn't going to do it. So I pull back onto the road and head back the way I came.

Almost immediately, Evan begins crying.

When your son is crying and you are helpless, you can't help but feel guilty. I sincerely thought about stopping every other mile, taking him out of his car seat, and holding him. We would get home six hours later at that pace, but at least I wouldn't feel like an evil parent.

His yelling added to my anxiety. My family would hear tomorrow that my dad had three months to live. I would cling desperately to those 90 days, stretching them til they were threadbare and all the minutes and seconds were wrung out completely.

But right now, time couldn’t go fast enough. This car couldn’t go fast enough. I sped down the empty country roads as the afternoon sun sank in the sky, and I was wracked with fear of tomorrow and loathing for today, for me, for the decision to pack my things and go for a drive with the maniacal bend of putting an afternoon in my hands. My plan backfired spectacularly. I couldn’t control the one thing I meant to control.

This car ride still had 10 miles to go, so I stopped again. This time at the park above the lake. It is the same park where I drove during driving lessons. My friend slammed into a pothole much to the delight of all us backseaters and to the behest of our driving instructor. I loved that pothole. We named that pothole. My return visit here is entirely different. I grab the nearest sandy spot that is not road, and I rush into the backseat to hold Evan. He calms immediately, which I do not deserve. I have made him an accessory to my panic, and I am so, so sorry. What was I thinking? Couldn't I have buried this newfound sadness into my backyard of emotions, next to the other mounds I've created over the past year-and-a-half? Why couldn't I have compartmentalized like I usually do? But no, I had to run away from it all, like a loon, like a failed Ahab on a failed Moby Dick hunt.

Did I mention that I hadn't told my wife where we were? Whoops, slipped my mind. She was out of the house when I left, and she wouldn't necessarily expect me to be home when she returned. She also wouldn't have expected that I took our son on an excellent adventure and that he cried for 60 percent of the time.

The final stretch home happened just like all others. Crying from my son, regret from me. He wanted to be done with the car ride, I wanted to be done with cancer---for my dad, for all of us. I wanted to be home. I love home. Why did I ever leave in the first place? Home is my hideout, my refuge, my fortress of comfort. A rational mind would have simply sulked on the couch for a few hours while his wife cooked biscuits and gravy. This? This is ludicrous.

I pulled into the driveway a changed man. I knew that there was no escaping this cancer. This cancer was one of us now. It was staying in our guest room with no departure date. It was borrowing my toothbrush, sleeping in my shorts. Driving 45 minutes to nowhere wasn’t going to change the outcome of anything. Still, I was glad I did it. I would have eaten that sofa, like I promised. But I was also glad to be back. I was glad that my son was safe and warm and will forget all my bad decisions I ever make, this one being the last.

Moreso, I was ready for tomorrow. Just let me gas up the car.

We arrived at the doctor's office the next day.

My mom, my dad, my brother, and I were stuffed into a coffin of a room, designed most likely for three persons maximum plus the occasional elephant or 1,000-pound gorilla. Both creatures were present and accounted for. The elephant in the room was sitting on my lap. The gorilla was grooming the nurse.

Some of us were standing and others are sitting. Then we rotated. Then others stood and some sat. We all stood. We all sat. Someone just tell us what to do!

We knew bad news is coming. The anticipation hung like a pall over the room, like an inversion of life-and-death proportions. The only time that all four of us were together for doctor's appointments were when things turned serious---either we were waiting to be told my dad is cancer free, hooray! it was all just a big old mix-up at the lab, someone swapped another person's biopsy for my dad's, that somone has been fired, here's a million dollars for scaring you, or the more inevitable conclusion, the one you commonly receive in spades when touring Cancervania, that it's cancer, it's bad, and there's not a whole lot we can do for you.

This doctor's appointment had all the trappings of bad news. It had been a year-and-a-half since my dad's cancer diagnosis, and he had exceeded all expectations by living this long with this much quality of life. He was playing with house cards, as it were (a 2-3 offsuit, perhaps? you're not dealt a very good hand when you have cancer). He was bound to run out of time, or cards, or whatever this metaphor would have you.

Also not working in his favor was that each new treatment seemed to cure his cancer to a lesser and lesser degree. To be clear, none of them have actually cured his cancer in the slightest, but each one, for those few glorious days when they stave off cancer's assault, feels like a miracle cure when you're so desperate that those kinds of things exist. He had tried Temadar, Avastin, chemo, radiation. Each one afforded him precious, bonus days to spend with my mom and our family, so they have more than earned their keep. But as of yet, no solution had been able to stick around long-term. These drugs were me with new creative projects. Everything looks great for a week or two, sometimes months, and then I get bored and move on to other things. Temador and Avastin are playing video games. Chemo found a new idea that will Change America As We Know It. Their staying power was lessening, and I was worried it will eventually just fade away.

Today was the day, and this was the appointment, where we reach the end of the line. No one will be surprised that the doctor has bad news for us and yet, we will gasp and our hearts will leap and my Adam's apple will swell to the size of a hot air balloon. We understood that the inevitable had arrived, and we were standing/sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in a coffin of a clinic room, waiting for confirmation.

The doctor came in. He got right to the point, which I appreciated. No messing around with this cancer business. I imagine he's given prognoses so often he could do it in his sleep and probably does just that considering how nightmarish it is to be cast in such a role. "Your loved one is dying, will be dead in three months, will be dead tomorrow. Sorry. Want a hug?"

I needed a hug. My dad had three to six months left.

We kids of death are a unique bunch. No one gets us.

For instance, do other kids worry about losing their remaining parent because that remaining parent is the only thing separating them from being an orphan?

Do other kids experience Father’s Day or Mother’s Day as a holiday of oddness rather than celebration?

It’s tough for us. But we’re kind of a neat exclusive club. Losing someone causes significant changes in the person that you are, and the person that you are becomes this beautiful, hardened, seasoned piece of art.

And we pieces of art get each other.

It would be so extremely hard to go through this loss if Lindsay hadn’t had anything close to a similar experience. If I had lost my dad and then met her, we’d have been coming from two different worlds. As it is, we are in very much the same world - a terrifically identical world just about.

And when I meet others who have lost a parent, I have this instant connection. It’s like meeting a long-lost brother. You can connect with someone by simply admitting your loss, which then auto-fills a complete history of hurt, pain, sorrow, growth, learning, experiencing, and living.

It’s kind of a kinship - a kinship that no one really talks about.

I had lunch with a friend who lost his dad, and when we discovered that we shared the similar type of loss, we just kind of went, “huh.” We knew one another on a whole new level in an instant. We differed wildly in the things we like and the activities we pursue and the religion we choose, but we have one hugely important common bond in that we lost someone we loved truly madly deeply. And having loved and lost, we are bonded together forever.

On my 28th birthday, I lit a fire in the backyard.

Up to that point, I had swore off the traditional symbolism and rituals and various what-have-yous of cancer. Those were for the weak-minded, for those who couldn't evoke change on their own, childish pursuits of a superstitious world. But I was wrong. These events are helpful, in their way. They don't give us our loved ones back or cure cancer or turn the clock to yesterday or five years ago or whenever you need the clock to be, but they do perform the noble service of giving us, at minimum, reprieve and, at most, peace of mind.

For the past ten months, I had been learning how to live with a sick father. He was diagnosed with brain cancer in November, did the surgery, the radiation, the chemo, the usual. He changed. He transformed before my eyes. Got better. Got worse. He cried. Laughed. Bargained. Questioned. I did it all along with him, two miles down the road, two feet from his bed.

It had been a long 10 months. I was ready to be done with it all. I was ready to lose all the awful parts of cancer and never go looking for them again.

My solution was simple, elegant, pyrotechnic.

Sadness. Fear. Sorrow. Regret. Anger. I wrote these words down on a piece of paper I intended to burn, to send to its fiery end right there in my backyard, to burn it to disgusting ash or, better yet, to nothingness, as if these words never existed and never had a need to. I wrote these feelings down because I was done with them. I had felt them intimately for the past 10 months as I dealt with the cancer of a man I loved. I had felt them enough.

My wife had gone to bed. The sun had set. The subdivision was still. It was time to burn this paper to the ground.

Wait. I paused, thinking, this is dumb, this is dangerous. This is the worst idea I have ever had. Who burns a piece of paper of feelings in his own backyard? John Cusack might, in a romantic comedy. But right before he did, Kate Beckinsale would burst through the fence and tell him she loved him. They would open-mouth kiss. What kind of latent rom-com fantasies am I exorcising by doing this? And on a related note, is Serendipity on Netflix?

I vacillated between confidence and fear for several minutes. My mind flip-flopped at warp speed before finally landing on "burn."

Then practicality emerged: How would I be able to control this fire?

I hadn't thought of that. I had a match and some paper and that was it. How does paper burn exactly? Does it burst into flames? Does it combust on contact? Where does the fire marshal live? Does my neighborhood allow symbolic bonfires? How do the paper people get the college-rule lines on here?  Are the college-rule lines kerosene-based?

I rushed inside to grab a glass of water. When the inferno got out of control, I thought to myself, I would dump a cup-and-a-half of water on the blaze. That should indemnify me in the courts should I get prosecuted for burning the whole town to the ground. But your honor, I had a glass of water with me. I prepared! The argument was bulletproof.

With emergency water on hand, paper and match ready to go, the time had come.

Shouldn't someone say something?

I thought my ceremony might need an introduction, some context. I knew why I was burning this piece of paper, and I was to be the only one around when it happened, but still. A gesture so thoughtful deserved a proper speech. Not out loud, that would be weird. Inside voices. Inside my head.

Maybe an internal dialogue would be enough. It would have to be, for if I had waited any longer, I probably would have flip-flopped back into thinking burning a list of words was a bad idea. It wasn't a bad idea. It was a great idea. Noble even. Legal?

Is what I was about to do even legal?

Good point. But too late! It was happening, I lit the match, I set the match to the paper.

I watched those awful feelings burn.

Whoa, it really burned fast. It was as if the paper was meant to disintegrate on impact, like it prepared its whole life for fire drills. Everyone collapse into a pile! Ready, go! The paper was gone within three seconds. Almost immediately after lighting it, I had to throw it onto the patio cement because I feared second-degree burns on my fingertips. It burned hot and fast, and I doused it with water. Then I stepped on it. I rubbed it into the cement and then thought about the long-term effect of fire damage on the concrete. Great. Every time I saw this black smudge of ash, I would think of all the sorrowful words I had intended to forget. Whoops, I had accidentally erected an everlasting monument to my worries and fears while trying to do the exact opposite. Oh, wait. Never mind. It wiped away super easy. I overreacted.

Two weeks later, my dad got an MRI result that showed his cancer was progressing.

My big act bought me 14 days.

10a.

Here's one thing you never think you'll do in your twenties. Choose a hospice agency. But there I was researching the ins and outs of insurance, end-of-life care, and all the rest, trying to divorce myself from the fact that I was choosing all this for someone who shouldn't be dying.

I called agency after agency, asking the most novice questions, like the world's most unprepared interview. "So what do you all do?" "Mm-hmm, and how do all the costs work?"  "Makes sense, and where do you see yourself in 10 years?" I put way too much emphasis on whether an agency did animal therapy. I really wanted to pet a dog! Like, all the time. I found all my leads via Google, I became all too familiar with how 24/7 emergency phone support looks like, I learned the word palliative.

I did all this behind a closed door in my office at work, chatting about death and mortality and Do Not Resuscitate while my coworkers streamed past unaware. Life was so filled to the brim with hanging on to my dad, helping my mom, raising Evan, loving Lindsay that I had to take any chance I could to figure things like hospice out.

Here's the most amazing thing: It worked out great. We found an agency that was completely focused on the individual. My conversation with them was less about the specifics of Medicare and insurance, and more about the best way that they could help my dad get the most joy and comfort from these final few months. If money and insurance ran out before my dad left us, they'd comp everything for as long as it took. They were unique to all the other agencies that I found, and I'm so lucky they came my why.

While I'd like to think that I was capable of caring for my dad, that me and my mom could figure things out, we couldn't. No chance. I was a leaky ship straining for the shore and without our getting outside help to make all this smoother, I would have sunk before ever reaching the docks. Hospice was great for us. Lisa, Lenny, Heather and gang were tolerated by my dad. They were adored and beloved by me.



***

My grieving process has evolved over the years from emotion-burying to emotion-sharing. Now, I let my emotions get the best of me whenever they want. I try to be open about the way I feel. I am vulnerable, but only around people I trust or, in the case of seeing my dad's brain tumor MRI for the first time, every person on the fifth floor of the hospital.

The latest manifestation of my grieving process has been openly and honestly confronting my fears and sadness. When a terrifying thought pops into my mind, I embrace it, like a toddler embraces a housecat---firmly, desperately, curiously because I have never seen anything like it before and I cannot move on until I have at least touched it and know how it feels. It is not a loving embrace. I do not love my sadness. I downright hate my fears. When I explore a fear, it feels like a fight, and I'm a fighter who doesn't know what I'm doing. I can see myself flailing, eyes closed, trying desperately to survive somehow, some way. Is it legal to use my car keys? I'm going to use my car keys. I always thought I would use car keys if I were ever called into a real fight.

My most recent fight happened yesterday when a tangential thought took me to the Thunderdome. My dad could die of starvation. My dad could die of starvation. I was thinking about his difficulty eating, and I flashed forward to a day when he may not be able to eat at all. What does his living will say about that? Would he just be left there to starve to death? How would he bear that news if he still was thinking clearly? How awful would it feel to starve to death in your own house? The emotional fight took a nasty turn at that point. My confidence withered into a flurry of flailing punches and kicks directed at nothing in particular. My fear was punching me in the face. I wanted so much to recognize this possibility as something worth considering, yet when I considered it, it knocked me out. I was toast. I scampered out of the ring, through the tunnel, and ran out of the arena. I'd huge my fears and fight again tomorrow.

Is it brave to embrace sadness with a smothering hug? Am I courageous for fighting fears ignorantly? Sometimes it doesn't feel like it. Sometimes it feels rash and foolish to dwell on hard things when it'd be so much easier to bury them and move on to anything else---TV, Tumblr, lifting weights to get huge, eating sweets to get huge, doing drugs, walking into the street. It's a slippery slope when emotions this heavy sit on your heart. Eventually, your heart will do anything to get away.

The thing about death is it is real.

Sitting at home watching TV is not real.

Going to the movies is not real.

Playing games is not real.

I can spend so much of my life devoting time to aimless pursuits when really what’s it all good for? There are fewer real things than I realize, and here is the big one---the biggest of the big---staring me in the face. Life. Death.

It makes me think. It makes me want to experience something true and real. So much of what I do every day is going through the motions or living out life in a non-imminent way. What is imminent? Dying, struggling, bleeding.

I’d never considered suicide or cutting or mutilation seriously. I did understand the draw.

Bleeding is the most real thing I can imagine. Blood is what keeps you alive, and to tap into that is powerful, significant.

And you have control.

These are terrible harmful thoughts to have, I know. But they were there. In the midst of struggling through a situation with my dad that I could not control, a situation that brought to mind with great force and power the fact that I don’t have any idea what’s going on whatsoever, the comfort and intrigue of taking my life into my own hands was tempting. I never came anywhere close to doing it. But I had the thoughts. I mused. I wondered.



There was never a plan, just curiosity. I'd been standing at the cusp of my dad's illness for more than year, and the reality of death was coming closer and closer these final few months. We had drugs in the house---emergency morphine and powerful sedatives that hospice had to sign over. We talked of mortality. We talked about the human body and what it does when it flips the sign from Open to Closed. All these biological, medical factors that were so hugely important to us during this time, they sent my mind spinning. And it was all so foreign and chaotic to me.

I just---I just wished to have some control back. I longed to be the decision maker for something meaningful, and the meaningful thing that came to mind was me.

Was it the lowest point for me during all of this? It didn’t feel low. It felt quite scary to even have the thoughts, but I didn’t feel like I was at my wit’s end and thisclose to doing something reckless and harmful and permanent.

If anything, I felt at ease allowing myself to experience the complete spectrum of emotions that come with a dying father. Had this one popped up and I buried it, I’m not sure where that would have left me or what it would have looked like when it came back around later. I hugged the thought, I touched the thought, I fought the thought, and I won.

11.

What a day. And not in the "can you believe all the fun stuff we did" kind of way---though there was a lot of fun stuff---but rather in the "can you believe how much I just cried" kind of way. I cried more, sitting in our dining room from dusk to dark as the orange sun set out the window, than I had since I first saw my dad's MRI and we all took off on this rollercoaster.

My brother Kenton and his fiancee Nikki held their wedding rehearsal dinner, I emceed, and if I may be so bold, I nailed it. There were games and gags and laughs-a-minute. My brother deserved a celebration that went all out for him, especially for something so important in the midst of something so difficult, and I was happy to pour a bit of myself into what I hope he remembered as the happiest weekend of his life.

So how could something so happy end with my sobbing afterward at my dining room table? I sure party weird.

It was never my intention for the night to bring out these types of emotions. I really didn't see it coming. But from the moment I set foot on my parents' driveway and saw my dad sitting alone on the deck, watching others set up dinner tables, I started experiencing heartache in all its many forms. I walked over to him to see how he was doing, and he had that exasperated look on his face that was more and more common in his final days. He wanted to be able to help, but he couldn't. How frustrating it must have been to see a great celebration unfold before your eyes, in the backyard of the house that you built, and have no way of participating in any of it.

That was sad realization No. 1.

While we waited for everyone to arrive for the rehearsal, my dad sat at one of the tables, patiently waiting. Sitting with him, I caught my mind wandering into the past and imagining what the old dad would be doing right now if he were to have his health. He would be moving from station to station, overseeing everything and checking to make sure that it was all being done right. He would be greeting guests as they came in - greeting them by name - and extending a firm hand and warm smile. He certainly wouldn't be sitting idly by, watching the party pass right in front of him. Or if he was, he would be cracking jokes and making observations about how it's 4:45 and we were supposed to start at 4:30. If he was trying to say that tonight, I definitely did not understand him.

The wedding party met at the far back of the backyard. Everyone but my dad, that is. He sat several hundred feet away at a table in the shade, looking down on the action below. He sat alone.

Again, my mind raced to how different things would be for my dad if he was healthy. I barely needed to form the thought before the emotions came flowing and my heart started aching. I don't know that I even got a chance to fully comprehend what I was feeling because the hurt I felt was so intense I could only take it in little amounts.

This is not the way life's supposed to be! My dad deserved the chance to fully experience the wedding of his son. You could hardly call my dad's evening a full experience. He stayed through all of it, God bless him. If I were him, I might have ducked out after the third game we all played. Did he participate? No. Did he enjoy himself? I'm not sure. Did he understand what was happening? I hope so.

After the games ended, it was time for speeches. I read a written message from my mom and dad to Kenton. The three of them sat on the deck together, my mom and dad side-by-side on the swinging porch chair and Kenton in a chair beside. At my rehearsal dinner, my dad gave a toast (he has never been one for speeches), and he cried during it. I will always remember that as one of the most special moments of my wedding. Kenton didn't get to have that, which may have played into the emotions of the written speech. The speech was also several multiples of sweet.

Toward the end, I peeked over the papers to see my family sitting on the deck together. Their faces were red, and their hands were together. I'm pretty sure they were all crying. I almost lost it myself toward the end of the speech. My voice cracked, and I stuttered through some sentences. But I rallied. The last sentence was a funny memory of Kenton, and had it been anything other than that, I may have not made it through.

After a speech from Nikki's parents, Kenton was up. He stood on the lawn and spoke straight to my parents. He started a story about my dad and immediately began crying. Through tears, he shared about how my dad would let him sit on the couch beside him while my dad worked on plumbing bids and paperwork. Kenton sat beside him that way for years, even as a teenager. It was a sweet story, made a million times sweeter by the vulnerability Kenton showed in crying his way through it. I cannot even imagine the emotions that must have been running through his head that weekend. Happiness. Sadness. Pain. Regret. Hope. So I guess I can imagine them. I'm just not sure which one he felt at any given time. Maybe neither did he.

After the program had ended and as Lindsay and I were about to head home, my mom found me. More like appeared. And before I could get a single word out, she wrapped me in full-on embrace. We hugged for a good two minutes. I wish it could have been forever. She was sobbing from the moment she put her arms around me, as if she was giving me the weight of her very heavy world. I was more than happy to take it.

She talked about memories, still mid-hug, mind you. How she will always remember this night as a happy memory. How she hopes for more.

All these things combined to just make the night exhausting. I was at my wit's end, my point break, and I hadn't realized it until I broke. I got home, had something to eat, and sat, empty, at the dining room table. Empty of answers. Empty of patience. Empty of that magical potion that keeps hard feelings buried deep inside. So they all came out.

This is all so much harder than I expected.

I can't do this anymore.

I can do it, but I need some help.

I can't do it alone, yet I can't keep but trying.

I want so badly for this weekend to be a happy weekend, but I don't know if it will be.

I can't imagine what my mom is going through: the love of her life down to his last days and unable to participate in the marrying off their son. This isn't the way they pictured it. And my dad, how hard it must be for him to be unable to help and unable to do much of anything and even more so that he can't tell anyone how frustrating and sad it makes him feel.

I don't even know which parent has it harder.

I don't want this wedding to be about my dad, but I'm having a hard time seeing how it will be anything else.

Tonight I had the sense that everyone there felt sorry for my family.

When I think back on all the wonderful things my dad did for me at my wedding, and I think about Kenton not having the same experience ...

I can't do this any more.

How am I going to deal with it when the wedding is over on Sunday and real life begins? When hospice starts on Monday? When my dad needs a wheelchair on Tuesday?

This wedding was supposed to be a distraction, but all it has been is a reminder of how sad everything is. 

I wish I could fast-forward to five years from now when we've all mourned and grieved and come out the other side as better people. I know this will all happen. I just want to be done with this and to move on.

I had a lot to sob about, and so I did.

I was exhausted, from crying, from cancer, from everything.

***

My brother got married, and instead of being the emotional wreck I expected myself to be, I kept it together. I didn't run away. I didn't flee. I only cried a little, you might have even thought it was just sweat.

It helped that I was at the point of exhaustion all evening, had gone almost 12 hours without eating, and saw very little of my parents the entire night. I was exhausted again, and this time not so much from the stress of my dad's cancer but from the physical toll of running back and forth for an entire half day.

I'm glad things worked out this way. I wanted Kenton's wedding to be a happy memory for him, so when I made it through my toast without crying one bit, it was a good thing. I had expected to cry, and part of me maybe even wanted to cry. But I didn't.

The ceremony, however, was another story. The two families convened during the ceremony for prayer around my parents (the prayer was going to happen on stage, but we didn't think my dad would want to walk there). I was fine for the most part up until then. The way I was sitting on stage made it so that my view was of Kenton's back and the arbor and the backdrop of trees at the front of the stage, so I didn't have to fight off the emotions of seeing my mom cry and seeing my dad, period. During prayer, though, I opened my eyes halfway through and watched my mom. She was crying pretty hard, not outright sobbing but a little heaving every now and then. I don't know if they were happy wedding tears that she cries at every wedding she attends and especially so at the weddings of her sons, or if they were mournful tears because of the difficult circumstances of the day. When prayer ended, I felt the tears roll down my face.

Those were the only tears of the day. I came close one other time when a friend told me how much she cared for me and how she could see the weight of the world on my shoulders. I told her, "You can't tell me that," as some sort of defense mechanism to avoid a full-on meltdown in the middle of the reception area. I wanted to say, "Yes, and it sure is heavy! And I can't bring myself to let anyone else carry it."

My parents had a table off to the side of the reception, in the shade, and a couple of my dad's closest friends sat and talked with him throughout. I was relieved to know he was well taken care of.  I wanted to walk him to his seat, but someone beat me to it. I wanted to sit with him and guard him from others, but I never had the chance. I'm not sure what the day was like for him, to be honest. I'd like to think it was a happy day, and I saw nothing from him that would make me think otherwise. But I'm sure there were parts that were hard.

For me, one of the hardest parts was the difference between Nikki's family and Kenton's family. Nikki's dad was able to fully participate in the festivities, help out where needed, be mobile for pictures and toasts and dinner and everything in between. My dad was not. I felt jealous ---jealous that everyone there was so healthy and happy and that their lives tomorrow wouldn't be all that different than today. Ours would.

At the end of the night, I sought out my parents to say good-bye. I gave my mom a big hug and told her that they should feel proud for raising Kenton the way they did and content knowing he found an amazing someone to spend the rest of his life with. I think my parents used to worry about us boys ever marrying. And here we were, the two of us with our best friends by our sides. She seemed happy. I think we all were. The emotions of the night before seemed to stay there.Today was different.

I ran around to the other side of the car as it was pulling away, and grabbed onto my dad's hand through the window. I told him "I love you." I should have said more. I was just so tired.


12.

After the wedding, for the first time in many days, I felt sick to my stomach with all that is happening to my family. Literally, I was nauseous - not sea-sick nauseous but rather nauseous like you just drove past a car crash or you lost control of something near and dear to you. Emotional nausea? Is that a thing? If so, I had that.

So much was happening---most of it in one morning---and it all conspired together to crush me. I watched my dad walk from the couch in the family room to the hardwood floor near the nook. I've seen him walk dozens of times, but this time was different. I think it was my perspective. I was standing in the kitchen, looking down at him, and it was an out-of-body experience for me. Is that really my dad? Is this really happening to us? When I am standing next to him as he walks, I can't see the forest through the trees. Stepping back, I can see everything, and it is agonizing.

I struggled for the rest of the morning to grasp what I saw. For sure, it magnified my agitation for the rest of the day. I bristled when I heard the hospice nurse refer to our life now as "the new normal." There's nothing normal about a dad with cancer, and I will fight heaven and earth to make sure it stays that way. She pressed us about having those deep talks with my dad that we have yet to have. I didn't feel guilty for not having them, I felt annoyed that people keep bringing them up. We're handling it the best way we know how. And we don't know how! We're making it up as we go, building our wings as we tumble through the air.

Other things that compounded my mood: I saw that my mom had given my dad Lorazepam three days ago and never said anything to me about it, I felt like the hospice appointment was rushed either because my mom didn't want to talk anymore or because the nurses didn't say enough about what they thought, I had to request more info on my dad's high diastolic blood pressure reading. I just felt like I was fighting all morning long. And I'm too tired to fight.

It's not a feeling I enjoy. When I left the house that day, a month into my dad's three-to-six-month prognosis, it was like I was escaping. I had never felt that way before.

My mom told us the week before that she has thought about running away to our family's cabin in the mountains when this is all over. Not for good, but for awhile.

Is it bad that I thought about running away that day? Before it was over?

***

I was just so tired of everything. I was tired of seeing my dad struggle. I was tired of the countless different ways that cancer has uprooted our lives. I was tired of feeling hopeless. When the nurse talked about the progression of my dad's disease, she was matter-of-fact about the many ways he was declining as expected. His diastolic blood pressure was high, which was a sign of an expanding tumor. His eyesight was worsening. His movements were slowing. Cancer was a roller coaster ride, and I felt the cold, metal lap restraint pressed against my legs. We were on a track with no escape, and our only option was to ride it out to its inevitable end. Who knew when that would be. Who knew what else we'd encounter along the way. We were stuck, enduring the unendurable. Where was the hope in that? The only way out was when it's over. We could take hope that it will end. Someday. Sooner than we would have ever wished for and also not soon enough.

***

There were good days and there were bad days for my dad, and there were good days and there were bad days for me. On my bad days, I just didn't know if I could do this any longer - and not from a control perspective where I felt like I was failing everyone around me. That part was still there, always. This weariness was different. I couldn't see how I'd be able to take weeks more of this, months more of this. They say that brain cancer is a relief because, in the end, it goes quickly. I was thinking quick to be days, not months. We were at the 50-days mark since the doctors told my dad there is nothing more they could do. My store of emotional energy lasted 48 days. I really felt like I had nothing left. I hope d I'd find some stashed away in the corners of my heart and mind or that God in his grace could grant me a loan of perseverance and determination. I gave to Lindsay, I gave to Evan, I gave to my mom, I gave to my dad. I was out. I felt like I was rationing parts of myself to all these different places and just trying to get by day-by-day, hoping I'd have something to give tomorrow. If any of these important people were to plead with me for more, I knew I could have dug down deep and found it. I'm sure there was a glass case of energy buried deep within me with a Break In Case of Emergency sign hanging from it. If we were 49 days in, if we had 49 more to go, I couldn't imagine that glass case would stay unbroken. I couldn't even guarantee it would stay in tact through the weekend.

Fifty days in, I felt like a son who was losing his dad.

It was a vulnerable way to feel and a departure from my usual role as a son providing for his family. I didn't know how to say good-bye to one of the most important people in my life.

***

I caught myself staring one night as my dad sat and slept on the couch. There was a certain peacefulness about his sleep that I find comforting. It was one of the reasons I couldn't help but watch him.

I also looked at him because I still had to pinch myself to know that this terrible episode of life was in fact real. Sometimes I couldn't believe it until I really looked closely at my dad and saw the changes. Obviously, the changes were there; his body was smaller, his face weaker. But when I looked closer, I connected the disease with the dad. At a glance, I saw a man who was being reduced by illness.

Upon closer inspection, I saw my dad.

It was easy to separate the two by remaining distant, and sometimes it was preferable to do so, especially when I struggled to handle the implications of reality. I'd been there. Lots of times. But I had also grown to appreciate the value in confronting the difficult things in life and taking life's punches head on.

There is a picture of my family in my head. We are together, smiling, young and healthy, not a worry or fear in sight. Most every photograph of my family is just like this. I want so badly for this to remain my only picture. I wish I could be blissfully unaware. I wish I were still naive. A former version of myself would have taken all these hard things about cancer and death, put them in a box, and never opened the box again. I would have looked the other way when something difficult happened. I would have convinced myself that everything was okay---by taking things out of context, by assuming, by ignoring---when it was definitely not okay. But this new version of myself won't let me. I sincerely hope that it has been worth it to be sold out on embracing every aspect of my dad's disease, to be present as often as possible with my dad and mom, to know everything, and to shy away from nothing. I hope it's been worth it. I trust it's been worth it. As I mature, I know that my box of bad feelings would never last. It wasn't big enough. It was made of flimsy cardboard and held together with chewing gum. I knew exactly where I placed it, and I had to step over it time and time again whenever anything close to those bad feelings appeared. In my dad's final days, I chose to go without a box, and I hoped dearly it was the right decision.

It wasn't an easy decision. There were times when I wished that I didn't know everything I know or didn't see everything I see.

There were also times when I sat alone, with nothing but me and my thoughts, and I felt peace.

***

At 4:30 a.m. in the final weeks with my dad, I got a call from my mom. My dad was on the floor. He had fallen while being moved from the couch to the bathroom. He was fine. My mom was fine. She needed my help picking him up.

So out to the house I went. My dad was lying up against the front of the couch, sitting up, quietly. I picked him up from the floor and placed him on the bed. We took his shirt off, and I lifted him into a more comfortable position.

He was agitated, so I drew some Lorazepam and put it into a beverage for him to drink. I held it up to his lips, and he drank slowly, one gulp at a time. He swallowed twice, about 15 seconds per swallow, then drank some more. It was shocking for me to see how difficult it was for him to swallow.

I left him in bed and went back home.

I could hardly fathom that I helped my 56-year-old dad move his body and drink and swallow and sleep. Yet at the same time, I was so aware of everything as it happened, and it was clear to me how real this all was. I could not shake the images from my mind, nor did I want to. Eventually, yes, I hoped those images would fade and get replaced by the happy, healthy ones that I knew were kicking around in my head somewhere. But then, for only a little while longer hopefully, my life was not about the happy, healthy things. My life was about enduring today, providing for my parents, and loving my family. There is a season for everything, even this short season of incredible difficulty. The moment at my parent's house, the phone call during the night, felt like a new beginning of the end.



13.

I don't want to forget the things that happened before my dad passed away. I also, sometimes, don't want to remember them.

Toward the end, he was terribly agitated when he wasn't asleep. He would pull at the sheets and pull at the tubes. He was moved out of his bedroom and into the living room, in a hospital bed where the couch used to be. He was at home and yet he wasn't. He was in our house and yet still not quite home.

In a quieter moment, a restful moment, my mom told me that at one point, as she leaned over him, he reached out and hugged her. She treasured that moment. It may have been their last hug.

Lindsay and I were at the house every evening, with Evan in tow. We sat and watched TV, we read, we talked while my dad slept. We stayed late into the evening and returned the next day to check in and to help. In my case, to control, to make any little impact I possibly could. Hospice prepared us for what may happen toward the end of my dad's life. He may experience a burst of energy and want to eat a big meal and do something active. He may have an outburst. He may have a seizure, despite the medications he was taking specifically to prevent against seizures. If a seizure were to happen, his body would stiffen and his eyes would fixate on a spot in the direction of the tumor, in my dad's case up and to the left.

Toward the end of these discussions, the hospice nurse made plans to see us again in a week. I asked him, "Are you confident that my dad will make it to then?"

"No," he said.

That night was a calmer night for us. My dad was on less medication, and still he slept. He slept a lot. For the most part, he had been refusing food and water, and we were giving him hydration in the form of wet towels, ice chips, and sponges. Monday night, he ate some pudding from Kenton and some mashed potatoes. It was a slow, strange process feeding your father, but I think in the moment when you are doing it, you don't really consider how odd and awful the circumstance might be. We just did it.

The following day, a Tuesday, I went through my work day in a fog. I was preparing to go into my afternoon meeting when I got a call from my mom. Lisa, one of the hospice nurses, had been out at the house to assess my dad.

He was actively dying. She didn't know if he had hours left to live or days left to live but that he was quite near the end and family should come. He wasn't eating or drinking, and Lisa said that we didn't need to even offer it any more.

I left work immediately and went to the house.

He was asleep when I got there. I made a call to Deanna, couldn't get the words out, and had Lindsay tell her everything I couldn't. Tuesday night was family dinner night. It would be the first time my dad would meet his niece's new baby.

We ate, we talked, we did our best to make our best of the situation. Then everyone got up and went home, and it was just me, my mom, and my dad. I spoke with her about arrangements for the night. I wanted to sleep in the living room or the family room---I didn't want to push my mom out of her spot next to my dad, where she had been set on staying until he passed. But she suggested that she sleep in her own bed that night. I set up my things beside my dad.

I was sitting in the rocker on the right side of his bed, watching the Olympic women's 110m hurdles and typing on my laptop. I gave him a dose of medication, and when I went to give it to him, I noticed how rigid his mouth was and how unresponsive his body was to any touch.

At 10:15, my mom went to bed, and I remained by my dad's side. Not long after, he stopped breathing for 30 or 45 seconds. These breaks in breathing were considered normal for this stage of the disease. Still, I stared at him to see when the next breath would come; it came with a loud rasp and made me jump.

As I sat in the rocking chair next to the bed, he was turned toward me.

Several minutes later, he stopped breathing again. I hardly noticed at first. After a moment passed and I noticed the stillness in the room, and I turned to him. He still was not breathing. His chest was not moving. I stared at him for a few seconds and then got up. I spoke to him. No response. I stroked his face and told him how much I loved him. I searched for a pulse and couldn't find one.

As I stood shaking over the bed, I called to my mom, once, twice, three times - each one with more panic. The color had drained from my dad's face. I kept stroking him and staring at him until I couldn't take it any more and had to go get my mom. I ran to her bedroom where she was sleeping and roused her. We walked back to the living room, arm in arm. We stood beside his bed and confirmed what the other was thinking. He was gone.

When we all get to heaven

what a day of rejoicing that will be

when we all get to heaven

we’ll sing and shout the victory

It’s crazy how similar my dad and I look. Going through old pictures, he is me and I am him and I should probably have guessed all this since we’re related and all but still, truly, I am his spitting image.

When I hold Evan, it looks the same as when he held me.

When my dad posed for a picture or laughed as a young adult, I see myself. Everyone sees me. You can’t help but see the similarities, and it’s a good thing and a bad.

I see pictures of my dad from when he was younger, and I seize up. He had so much light in his eyes, joy in his face, and life in his bones. They’re pictures of a man who should have lived forever. I see those pictures, and I see myself, and then my mortality comes smacking me in the face again. I am him and he is me and he died at 55 years old so I guess my countdown clock is on.

Looking at pictures of my dad makes me miss him. It makes me nostalgic for my youth. It makes me appreciate just how head-over-heels in love he was with being a father and raising kids and being a family man. Looking at old pictures reminds me that I look that way now and that Evan could be looking back on pictures of me thinking, Man life sure isn’t fair is it. I’m dead and gone, and I’ll be just like my father.

These are horrible thoughts to have, of course. But so many thoughts are horrible when you’re thinking things about death and dying and missing your loved ones and wishing there was another way out besides the hard way.

I will say that the scary, mortal thoughts I have are at least nudged for competition by thoughts of love and wishful thinking and remembering. When I look at old pictures of my dad and see myself, I see a world of opportunity and expectation for me. I have a standard to live up to, not in a way that I’m being held with my nose to the grindstone but in a way that I have something to aim for, something good and true and noble worth pursuing. My dad reminds me of me, which reminds me that I am capable of being a better husband, father, son, and brother, a better friend, a more diligent worker, a more faithful giver, a more honest man. I have the awesome opportunity to live up to the standard that my dad left behind.

In that way, I guess, my dad keeps on living. He looks like me, I act like him, I carry on his legacy in whatever feeble ways I can and in whatever small ways I might.

He lives on.

I went through this with Lindsay when she lost her dad, and having experienced the same myself, I can honestly say I had no idea what I was doing, probably got in the way more than I got help, and generally was probably very far off in empathizing and sympathizing with her.

You have no idea what it’s like to lose a parent to brain cancer until you’ve lost a parent to brain cancer.

I’ll even go a step further. You have no idea what it’s like to lose a parent until you’ve lost a parent.

You have no idea what it’s like to lose anyone you love until you’ve lost him.

When Lindsay's dad died, I found myself clueless. I had no idea what was going on with her, and neither did she. It all happened when we were dating, which complicated matters extremely. Here I was falling in love with someone and she was in the midst of true heartbreak and losing some she dearly loved.

Death changes you. Lindsay was not the same person I started dating when we got engaged. I am not the same person I was before my dad got sick.

We’re talking big, wholesale changes. Death has a way of hanging with you for awhile, jumping out of the closet every now and then to remind you that you forgot to deal with this particular part that you had no idea existed. There is no means of fixing you after you’ve lost someone you cherish. Not that you may even want to be fixed. You are not broken but you’re changed. You are a beautiful piece of glass thrown into the fire, and you're molded, shaped, and different---yet still beautiful.  So it is when you experience grief and loss. You stay yourself and you look different.

From my perspective, you come out looking more beautiful than before.

And that’s the thing. Only those of us who have experienced death first-hand can see and understand this beauty. We are a special group, a chipped and charred and molded and melded group. We have striations that run through our core, shimmering when the light hits us just right. We’ve seen the full spectrum of life, all the scary parts that so many people are too busy or scared or lost to see. We’ve been tossed and turned and we’ve come out all the better for it.

This was what I didn’t really understand back then. Lindsay had so much to think about when her dad died, so many thoughts and fears and terrors swirling around in her head, I mistook her silence for apathy and her disinterest for dislike. We spent quiet walks together saying nothing, which was all that she wanted to hear and not at all what I was hoping for. We’d stop our nights together just because, and I’d walk home, wondering what to make of things.

I've been there now. I've sat in the chair and said nothing, I've gone for walks hand-in-hand without any means of putting my thoughts into words, with no way to say anything at all. I've stared off into space and run away and held back my worst fears and hid. She was there for me as I was there for her.

We chose to love each other through good and bad and happy and said, when the Patriots win and the Patriots lose, when we make delicious waffles and when I burn the toast. And when the hardest times hit, it's possible that we'll have no idea how to help one another and so we do the only thing we know how. We stick around. We watch the process of our beautiful, gleaming glass souls melt into brand new shapes, and we marvel at the art of it. We love what gets made, as much as we've loved anything before. We notice it all, and we carry it home.

As I learned through my dad’s illness, sticking around is one of the most important things you can do.

I’m still a young man so I think very little of death, but who really does till it’s coming for them? And I know with each breath I come one closer, but death is just a hook behind the door where I’ll leave my dirty clothes….
My Epic, “Perfector”

Keep your head up. we’re fine. Just keep your head up. I swear we’ll be alright.

Keep your head up. Oh, my friends, keep your head up. and I swear we’ll never die.

I swear we’ll get home safe and sound, we’ll live on underground

I will give your heart a place to rest when everything you had has turned and left.

I’ll weave your names into my ribcage; lock your hearts inside my chest.

Regain the passion I once carried; do away with all the rest.

I tore the sickness from your bodies; smashed its head against the bricks.

I made a castle from its bones that you may always dwell in it.

So sing for every buried moment that you’d thought would never end.

And sing your fears about the future; and a dirge for faded friends.

For all the love that you had held to, why it somehow failed to keep.

And sing each minute you’ve been frightened; every hour that you’ve lost sleep

And sing for all your friends and family; sing for those who didn’t survive.

But sing not for their final outcome; sing a song of how they tried.

We live amidst a violent storm; leaves us unsatisfied at best,

So fill your heart with what’s important, and be done with all the rest.

We are what’s left of what we once were

We are falling far behind.

There’s so much stacking up against us and we’re running out of time.

We are but hopeful children, and we’re the last of our kind.

But if we let our hearts move outward, I know we will never die.

When my dad was diagnosed with brain cancer, I knew I wanted to speak at his funeral. I thought of some great stories to share, and I heard these really great song lyrics that seemed appropriate, and I pictured this moving, emotional speech that would perfectly encapsulate everything I had been feeling for the whole 21 months.

I sat down to write that speech, and nothing came.

Part of the problem with knowing what to write is knowing what tone to take. I firmly believe that everyone should grieve in their own way. I have grieved in a lot of different ways at a lot of different times for a lot of different reasons. There is pressure – from whom, I don’t know – to be brimming with hope and praising God for taking my dad to heaven. But I still want him here. I have my hopeful moments, but I am not without my sorrow. I cannot have spent the past 30 years with a man like my father and not be broken to have to say good-bye.

But no one wants to hear a speech about that.

Then I read a note from one of his dear friends. My dad’s death was a struggle for him. I saw another friend, and when he hugged me, I could feel the loss. My dad was a great man. He was my hero. He was a hero to lots of people. He was an inspiration to those who knew him. I’m sorry, but it’s going to take me awhile to get over this one. And that’s okay. Others can give the message of hope, and I'll gladly listen and "Amen!", but it's also okay that things aren't okay.

I have been reluctant to look at old pictures of my dad.

That is a hard thing to be when you plan a funeral. You would be impressed at the lengths I took to avoid the video slideshow. I practically had to have a handler to make sure I didn’t see anything I didn’t want to see.

Not looking at pictures probably sounds more callous than it is. I am not afraid to remember my dad the way he was. I am afraid of crying and breaking down and losing control of my emotions, but I’m not afraid of remembering. During his last few months, I kept reminding myself and reminding my mom that the hard times will be overwhelmed by the good times soon enough. I believe this will be true. I have to believe it.

Thankfully, I don’t need the pictures to remind me of how he was. I can see him clearly when I close my eyes and draw from the memories I hold dear in my heart. I can see him and my mom, newlyweds, grinning from ear to ear in their first house – never happier than to be with each other. I can see him carrying me on his shoulders at the Oregon Coast, beaming with pride. I can see him in his Lee’s Plumbing hat, standing next to a work truck, in his Nampa Christian hat, coaching his boys. I can see him at every major event in my life and Kenton’s life and Lindsay’s life, thrilled to be sharing these moments with us.

When I think back on photos of my dad, he is so incredibly happy. To see him hold us boys when we were little is to see a man who needs nothing else in this world.

When I look at pictures of him, I see his happiness. I see his joy with his kids, his love for my mom, and the light in his eyes. When I look at pictures of my dad, I see myself.

The physical similarities are striking. We have the same smile, the same expressions. It’s remarkable.

"You look so much like him," my mom told me. "I'll  always have a piece of him here with me."

I’m sorry I remind so many people of him. But at the same time, what a privilege. I had 30 years to learn from the greatest man I have ever known, and it is an honor to carry on his legacy.

I don’t know if I am up for it, but I will never stop trying.

He was an incredible businessman – brilliant with his plumbing, diligent in his work ethic, and wise with his money. He taught me that there is more to life than what you do – an occupation can be a way into other people’s lives, and when I think of all the lives he has touched through work, it is simply staggering. He worked every day of his life to provide for us. I decided long ago that I wanted to provide for my family the same way he provided for his.

He considered everything good in his life a gift from God, and he gave richly out of what God had given. He was a man of integrity in all he did and generous with all he had. I can only hope to be the same.

I had the privilege of watching him interact with his friends, and I learned what it meant to be faithful, to be purposeful, to be loyal. He laughed with his friends, and he cried with his friends, and he was always there for them, no matter when they needed him or what they needed him for. One thing that stood out to me in the days after he passed is how many different people considered my dad to be one of the most important people in their lives. He lived in such a way – and was a friend to such an extreme – that he changed lives. I don’t know if I can be that good a friend, but I will try.

My dad loved the Lord. He was faithful to the church and to his ministries. His faith and the many beautiful ways it manifested itself served as such an example to me. My dad’s clearest moments of speech during the past few months were when he was praying to Jesus. He spoke to Him with a natural ease. When everything else was fading away, the one area that always remained was his love of the Lord. I want that for my own life. I want to be so devoted to Jesus that when you take everything else away, He remains – just as clear and strong as when I had everything.

I have seen the way my dad cared for his mom. When she was sick, for years, he visited her faithfully in the nursing home. When it was hard, he was there. When it was inconvenient, he was there. He didn’t have to tell me how much he loved my grandma or how a son should care for his mother, he showed me, plainly, with his actions. I like to think that he knew – or maybe it was God who knew – that one day my mom might need the constant, loving embrace of her sons and that my dad could show us how by caring for his own mom. I noticed, and I will never give up loving my mom like he loved his.

My dad was the rock of our family, and we so desperately need one now. I don’t make as good a rock as he does. I get emotional way too easily. But it’s a role I’m willing to embrace, provided I can keep his example close to my heart.

He was such a good father to us boys. A while back, I pulled out pictures from my childhood, and every single one of them, my dad is beaming from ear to ear. We were adored, completely and wholeheartedly. When I think of the way he looked at me, and the way I looked back at him, I can’t help but think of Evan and how I want his face to light up the same way mine did when I saw my dad and for Evan to know he is loved – undeniably, unmistakably, unconditionally. I wish I could ask my dad how he did it. I want so badly to be the father that my dad was to me.

He loved my mom with all his heart. I cannot even begin to describe the impact their marriage has had on my life. I learned what true love is all about. I learned how to treat your partner, how to love her and care for her, and how to never waver from your commitment to her. His example of being a husband is one that I will never forget. I can only hope to love Lindsay as much as he loved my mom – to be her everything, to stand by her at all times, to never leave her side.

When experiences like my dad’s disease happen, I find myself asking why. Why him? Why now? I don’t expect an answer, but that doesn’t keep me from asking. Oswald Chambers says, “God does not give us overcoming life. He gives us life as we overcome."

It’s true. It’s going to take awhile, but it’s true.

Toward the end, when things were more difficult, I found myself no longer hoping for earthly healing or a miracle cure. But that isn’t to say that I stopped being hopeful. Having faith that my dad would be healed was only one area where I could prove my faith. I had faith that there was something better ahead for him, I had hope that he would be at peace soon. I believe that the future holds good things. Asking God to heal my dad is one of the most common prayers I had prayed when he was sick. And I finally got what I wanted. My dad beat cancer because cancer cannot follow him where he is now.

When I needed a comforting metaphor for dying, the Lord gave me a song with these lyrics: “Death is just a hook behind the door where I’ll leave my dirty clothes.” I wasn’t sure how to picture that door – was it a door into heaven? a door out of this world? – until I started remembering all those times when my dad came in from work. He stepped through the door, hung his hat on the rack. My mom helped him remove his shoes, and he sank into the couch, relaxed, relieved, completely at peace to be at home where he belonged. Dying is not unlike that. My dad has changed out of his dirty clothes, he has hung his hat on the rack, his shoes are off, and he can enter through that door to the place he belongs.

He is home now.

“Life is a balance of holding on and letting go.” - Rumi

At one point, I thought I could make money by selling wish lanterns. People - sentimental people like me except with money and organization skills - would buy them in scads for these elegant ceremonies and remembrances each year. They would set them free over the ocean in a beautiful tribute to loved ones or cancer research or art. I would sell white and red and purple and tie dye. This would be my Four Hour Work Week solution. I would be rich.

I came to this conclusion while on Amazon, shopping for wish lanterns, bemoaning the lack of selection, and guessing at which of the three options of lanterns would be best and safest and least flammable in my hands. It was hard to tell.

I had this sappy idea in my head that we would honor the one-year anniversary of my dad’s passing with a ceremony. Many of my ideas are sappy, and I can usually recognize as much and scrap them before they come to fruition. Not this one. Wish lanterns held an elegant control over my actions.

We lit a wish lantern for my dad. It was sweet and reckless and very nearly burned down the neighborhood.

Thinking it would be a smart idea, a great way to remember him, Lindsay and I made plans to light one off and send it into the air to honor my dad, one year after he passed. It was August, and dark fell way too late at night for us to stay up and give the lantern a proper send off. So we put Evan to bed and headed out to the back porch at 7, at the very eve of dusk.

These lanterns, if you've never seen 'em, are quite the ingenious contraptions. They are 3D boxes of thin flimsy paper, rectangular and large enough to hold a blender. The lanterns ship flat, and you fold them into shape. At the bottom sits a small fuel packet that dangles from strings below the opening in the lantern's end. As the fuel burns, the warm air rises and catches in the lantern, lifting the lantern up and up and up into the sky and I guess it just incinerates or something when it gets high enough up? It goes high enough into the air that you can't ever see it again and an airplane scoops it up or a satellite or an alien or maybe all the lanterns we've ever lit are still floating up there somewhere on their slow jaunt to the moon.

I'd lit these lanterns many times before. The first was on an Oregon Coast trip where hundreds of us set off wish lanterns over the ocean, in the name of whatever cherished thing you wanted (dads, for me and Lindsay). We set ours off the summer after my dad was diagnosed. It was touching and beautiful and the things actually took off into the sky, which I had my doubts about before we lit them.

We also brought lanterns with us to my brother's wedding rehearsal. With just the families hanging out together, we took a couple lanterns out for a launch from the backyard and over the sugar-beet fields and into the sky. They rose slowly, kind of hovered over the ground, and we chased after them til they rose and faded into the gray evening sky.

And now, with blue skies and no breeze, with the sappy notion of doing something memorable for my dad, with our neighborhood quiet and oblivious to our sweet little ceremony, we lit one again and watched it rise.

It slowly lifted up from our back patio, over our back fence and into the air.

Then it veered sharply back toward our neighbors’ homes, rising and falling on a rocky climb up and out toward heaven. 
Then it stopped rising and stayed relatively flat. 
Then it started falling. 
Then it fell out of sight.

Mine and Lindsay's eyes met, huge white eggs of eyes filled with panic. Here we were, enjoying a nice remembrance of my dad---you see, the lantern represents something like his spirit, leaving this weary world on a gentle flight toward heaven. It's really beautiful to witness the elegant way that the lantern takes off from the ground and disappears into the air. Only ours disappeared into the neighborhood.

As we watched it rise and fall, we looked at one another first with tenderness ("Look at the beautiful thing we're doing!") then with worry ("Why isn't it going more than 20 feet in the air?") then with reassurance ("Of course it's going to keep rising. Science!") then with fear of going to jail ("It's most definitely burning on someone's roof right now!").

We hatched a rescue plan. I'd run around to the front of the house, in the direction of the rogue lantern, and see if I could spot anything amiss, like a bonfire in the street or on someone's garage. I couldn't stray far from our house because Evan was sleeping, blissfully unaware of our arson attempt. I'd need to stay near the house, looking for fires and listening for sirens, sirens come to put out the blaze and take us away.

Lindsay would run to the garage and hop on her bike. She'd ride around the neighborhood, non-chalantly so as not to arouse suspicion but also super fast so as to catch that burning menace.

We scrambled to our feet and put the plan in action.

As I ran to the front of the house, I thought, I just wanted to remember my dad! Why must everything break and burn all the time? I was so not in control. I was so pitiably out of control. Even my most well-organized, baby ideas seemed to spiral away from me, toddling off on their merry way no matter how much efforting or yelling or pleading I tried. I could not jam things into the shape I wanted, not with my dad's illness, not with loss, not with this burning box of paper that was to symbolize our triumphant overcoming and was instead probably sizzling in someone's tulip bed.
Reminders, constant and humbling reminders that I cannot do things all on my own, were everywhere. I need help. I can't drive away from bad news, I can't keep a family together all on my own, I can't bring my dad back, I can't light a wish lantern and have it go up. The reminders were everywhere, and I'd have to listen.

I watched as Lindsay burst out of the garage on her bike, taking a hard and fast left down our road toward the subdivision entrance. She pedaled past two, three, four houses and slowed to a stop. She got off the bike. There in the planter in the median of the road was the hot wreckage of our lantern, its fire piddling out beside a small bush. Nothing had burned down. No one was hurt. We were safe from prison time and embarrassment. Things were out of my control and yet it all worked out okay, I didn't have to worry, I didn't have to fear, I didn't have to try so hard all the time because others were willing to help and others were watching out for me.
And our ceremony was definitely over.

You find yourself at a crossroads, and you pause. Or maybe you push. Or maybe you pause then you push, having no clue how to move forward but needing to move nonetheless. That feeling of stagnation, when all the world around you is humming along yet yours has stopped, that feeling is so uncomfortable, so odd, like your arm's asleep but you're playing tennis.
You're at this crossroads, and you're stuck. What to do next? Why am I here? Why this crossroads of all the crossroads, couldn't it have been a cooler one like the one on the Beatles album cover? But no, you get this one and you have to figure it out on your own. You'll choose a path, you'll move ahead, and you'll face whatever comes next.
But you won't face it alone.
We'll be here with you, your friends and us strangers. We'll be with you because we've been there, too---different crossroads at different times but still the same bumpy dim paths that lead to somewhere.
They lead to the light, and we are waiting. We are pulling for you. We are praying for you. We have the giantest bear hugs and shoulders to cry on, and we've all just showered and put on the cologne of your favorite scent that smells like home.
You are not alone, and neither were we. It felt like it at times. We cried alone in the car, and we cried alone---surrounded by tens or hundreds of people---in our deep and utter lostness, our untethered futures, and our uncertain tomorrows. We cried and cried and then we lifted our heads up and we moved on. There was someone watching out for us, and there is someone watching out for you.
You don't have to do it all alone. You don't have to be in control. You don't have to worry about tomorrow and your future because it will all come soon enough and it will all work better than you could even imagine. Oh, if only you could know! You can't imagine all the good things now because you're in the midst of the bad, but trust me, glitter-bug, you've got great things ahead of you. Anything is possible, starting whenever you're ready.
We weren't ready for awhile, and that's okay. Take your time; we'll keep the love on the stove. No rush; we're not going anywhere. If you're not ready yet, we'll still be watching, cheering, pulling for you to pull through like we know you will, when the time is right and time has passed and the world's put back together.
You can do it.
We did it.
We're here now, on the other side of loss, to tell you that things get brighter. XOXO, hold on. Your invincible future sends its love.
