      <p>You find yourself at a crossroads, and you pause. Or maybe you push. Or maybe you pause then you push, having no clue how to move forward but needing to move nonetheless. That feeling of stagnation, when all the world around you is humming along yet yours has stopped, that feeling is so uncomfortable, so odd, like your arm's asleep but you're playing tennis.
You're at this crossroads, and you're stuck. What to do next? Why am I here? Why this crossroads of all the crossroads, couldn't it have been a cooler one like the one on the Beatles album cover? But no, you get this one and you have to figure it out on your own. You'll choose a path, you'll move ahead, and you'll face whatever comes next.
But you won't face it alone.
We'll be here with you, your friends and us strangers. We'll be with you because we've been there, too---different crossroads at different times but still the same bumpy dim paths that lead to somewhere.
They lead to the light, and we are waiting. We are pulling for you. We are praying for you. We have the giantest bear hugs and shoulders to cry on, and we've all just showered and put on the cologne of your favorite scent that smells like home.
You are not alone, and neither were we. It felt like it at times. We cried alone in the car, and we cried alone---surrounded by tens or hundreds of people---in our deep and utter lostness, our untethered futures, and our uncertain tomorrows. We cried and cried and then we lifted our heads up and we moved on. There was someone watching out for us, and there is someone watching out for you.
You don't have to do it all alone. You don't have to be in control. You don't have to worry about tomorrow and your future because it will all come soon enough and it will all work better than you could even imagine. Oh, if only you could know! You can't imagine all the good things now because you're in the midst of the bad, but trust me, glitter-bug, you've got great things ahead of you. Anything is possible, starting whenever you're ready.
We weren't ready for awhile, and that's okay. Take your time; we'll keep the love on the stove. No rush; we're not going anywhere. If you're not ready yet, we'll still be watching, cheering, pulling for you to pull through like we know you will, when the time is right and time has passed and the world's put back together.
You can do it.
We did it.
We're here now, on the other side of loss, to tell you that things get brighter. XOXO, hold on. Your invincible future sends its love.</p>
